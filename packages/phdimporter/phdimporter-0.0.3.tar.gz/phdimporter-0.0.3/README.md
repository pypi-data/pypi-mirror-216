# PicoHarp 300 TCSPC .phd file loader

This module was written to be able to read in `.phd` photon time histograms from the PicoHarp software.

The layout of the file is as documented in the [PicoHarp 300 manual](http://ridl.cfd.rit.edu/products/manuals/PicoQuant/PicoHarp%20300%20v2.3/manual/Manual.pdf) in section 8.2.1 (pages 56-58).

Both of these are easy to modify, however the scope of this projec tis limited to our usage case.

The module also loads `.txt` files which are the copy-pasted data from the PicoHarp software. This is primary way our research group has extracted data in the past, so it makes sense to keep the functionality alive.

For our friends at the University of Saskatchewan, I've also added `.asc` file loading.

## Installation

```bash
pip install phdimporter
```

## Usage

The module only uses one `struct` import and contains one class of importance, `TRF`.

```python
from phd import TRF

trf = phd('path/to/file/.phd')
## or
trf = phd('path/to/file/.txt')
```

The most simple way to return the histogram data is to:

```python
x = trf.x # bins in ns
y = trf.y # counts/bin
```

It is possible to pull raw data out from the .phd file since it's all stored in the `TRF` object, however I'm not going to document this as the variables share the same names as in the PicoHarp manual, and are easily seen in phd.py.

## Not Implemented

The importer has been written with a couple of limitations in mind that are based on our usage:

* Assumes only one histogram per file
* Assumes only one PicoHarp device on the machine

The only variable I haven't implemented is the acquisition time, as the computer that we use is not internet connected and the clock is always off, and I'm also not sure how to interpret the `time_t` data type that the variable is stored in.
