# Volterra Integral Differential Equation
We consider the first-order Volterra type integro-differential equation on $[0, 5]$ (from [Lu et al. 2021](https://epubs.siam.org/doi/abs/10.1137/19M1274067)):

$$
\frac{d y}{d x}+y(x)=\int_{0}^{x} e^{t-x} y(t) d t, \quad y(0)=1
$$
with the ground truth $u=\exp(-x) \cosh x$.

## 1D integral with Variable Limits
The LHS is represented by

```python
exp_lhs = sc.ExpressionNode(expression=f.diff(x) + f, name='lhs')
```

The RHS has an integral with variable limits. Therefore, we introduce the class `Int1DNode`:

```python
fs = sp.Symbol('fs')
exp_rhs = sc.Int1DNode(expression=sp.exp(s - x) * fs, var=s, lb=0, ub=x, expression_name='rhs',
                       funs={'fs': {'eval': netnode,
                                    'input_map': {'x': 's'},
                                    'output_map': {'f': 'fs'}}},
                       degree=10)
```
We map `f` and `x` to `fs` and `s` in the integral, respectively.
The numerical integration is approximated by Gaussâ€“Legendre quadrature with `degree=10`.
The difference between the RHS and the LHS is presented by a `pde_op.opterator.Difference` node,

```python
diff = sc.Difference(T='lhs', S='rhs', dim=1, time=False)
```

which generates a node with
- `input=(lhs,rhs)`;
- `output=(difference_lhs_rhs,)`.

The final result is shown as follows:
