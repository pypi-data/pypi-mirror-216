**IDRLnet** is a machine learning library on top of [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/). Use IDRLnet if you need a machine learning library that solves both forward and inverse differential equations via physics-informed neural networks (PINN). IDRLnet is a flexible framework inspired by [Nvidia Simnet](https://developer.nvidia.com/simnet>).

## Installation

Choose one of the following installation methods.

### PyPI

Simple installation from PyPI.

```bash
pip install -U idrlnet
```

Note: To avoid version conflicts, please use some tools to create a virtual environment first.

### Docker

Pull latest docker image from Dockerhub.

```bash
docker pull idrl/idrlnet:latest
docker run -it idrl/idrlnet:latest bash

```

Note: Available tags can be found in [Dockerhub](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/idrl/idrlnet).

### Anaconda

```bash
conda create -n idrlnet_dev python=3.8 -y
conda activate idrlnet_dev
pip install idrlnet
```

### From Source

```
git clone https://github.com/idrl-lab/idrlnet
cd idrlnet
pip install -e .
```


## Features

IDRLnet supports

-  complex domain geometries without mesh generation. Provided geometries include interval, triangle, rectangle, polygon, circle, sphere... Other geometries can be constructed using three boolean operations: union, difference, and intersection;

- sampling in the interior of the defined geometry or on the boundary with given conditions.

- enables the user code to be structured. Data sources, operations, constraints are all represented by ``Node``. The graph will be automatically constructed via label symbols of each node. Getting rid of the explicit construction via explicit expressions, users model problems more naturally.

- builds computational graph automatically;

-  user-defined callbacks;

-  solving variational minimization problem;

- solving integral differential equation;

- adaptive resampling;

-  recover unknown parameters of PDEs from noisy measurement data.

It is also easy to customize IDRLnet to meet new demands.
