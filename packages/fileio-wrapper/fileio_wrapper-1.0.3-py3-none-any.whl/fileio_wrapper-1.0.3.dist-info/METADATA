# fileio-wrapper 
This Python package is a wrapper for the file.io Restful API, allowing for easy 'uploading' and 'downloading' of files and retrieval of account information, such as storage usage and other relevant metrics.

## What is file.io?
File.io is a cloud storage service that allows users to easily upload files, share them via links, and automatically delete them after download or within a set time period for added security. By default, the service is configured to delete files after they have been downloaded once.
 

## Methods
| Method | Auth? | Restful API | fileio_wrapper                        |
| --- | --- | --- |---------------------------------------|
| Upload | Optional | POST / | Fileio.upload()<br>fileio.upload      |
| Download | Optional | GET /{key} | Fileio.download<br>fileio.download    |
| List Files | Required | GET / | fileio.list                           |
| Account Information | Required | GET /me | fileio.me                             |
| Update All | Required | PUT /{key} | fileio.update(mode='replace_all')     |
| Update Parital | Required | PATCH /{key} | fileio.update(mode='replace_partial') |
| Delete | Required | DELETE /{key} | fileio.delete                         

## Usage
### Install the package
[PyPI Package Link](https://pypi.org/project/fileio-wrapper/)
```bash
pip install fileio-wrapper
```
### Import the package
> #### Import Example: 
> ```python=
> from fileio_wrapper import Fileio
> ```

### Authentication
Some methods in this service do not require authentication, which means that you can upload or download files without needing to authenticate.
> #### Authentication Declaration: 
> ```python
> Fileio(api_key)
> ```
> #### Authentication Example: 
> 1. To generate your API key for file.io, go to https://www.file.io/account/apikeys
> ![](https://i.imgur.com/Ks9ZVpw.png)
> 2. To authenticate a Fileio instance, include the necessary credentials during construction
>    ```python=
>    fileio_api_key = 'XXXXXXX.XXXXXXX-XXXXXXX-XXXXXXX-XXXXXXX'
>    fileio = Fileio(fileio_api_key)
>    ```

### Upload
Uploading files to file.io is easy and can be done without authentication. However, if you authenticate with the service, you can manage your uploaded files and have access to greater storage capacity by purchasing a paid plan.
> #### Upload Declaration: 
> ```python
> Fileio.upload(file[, expires][, max_downloads][, auto_delete])
> fileio.upload(file[, expires][, max_downloads][, auto_delete])
> ```
> #### Upload Parameter
> | Parameter     | Description                                | Default Value | Free Account Limit |
> |---------------|--------------------------------------------|---------------|--------------------|
> | `file`        | The filepath of the file to upload         |               |                    |
> | `expires`     | The expiration date of the uploaded file   | 14 days       | 1 year             |
> | `max_downloads` | The maximum number of times the file can be downloaded | 1 | 1 |
> | `auto_delete` | Whether to delete the file when it expires or has reached the maximum number of downloads | `True` | `True` |
> 
> #### Upload Example:
> ```python=
> from datetime import datetime, timedelta
> from fileio_wrapper import Fileio
> 
> fileio_api_key = 'XXXXXXX.XXXXXXX-XXXXXXX-XXXXXXX-XXXXXXX'
> filepath = './file.txt'
> 
> # Uploade files without authentication
> # > The expiration date cannot be more than one year
> # > Both max downloads and auto_delete are unnecessary and cannot be changed
> Fileio.upload(filepath)
> Fileio.upload(filepath, expires="20221231T235959")
> 
> # Uploade files with authentication
> fileio = Fileio(fileio_api_key)
> fileio.upload(filepath)  # Default: expires='14d', max_downloads=1, auto_delete=True
> fileio.upload(filepath, expires=None)  # The file never expires (requires a paid plan).
> fileio.upload(filepath, expires="10m")  # Expiration time specified in a count-down format "^[1-9][\d]*[y|Q|M|w|d|h|m|s]$".
> fileio.upload(filepath, expires="20221231T235959")  # Expiration time specified in ISO 8601 format.
> fileio.upload(filepath, expires=datetime(2023, 1, 1))  # Expiration time specified as a datetime object.
> fileio.upload(filepath, expires=timedelta(seconds=60000))  # Expiration time specified as a timedelta object from now.
> fileio.upload(filepath, max_downloads=None)  # No limit on the number of times the file can be downloaded (requires a paid plan).
> fileio.upload(filepath, max_downloads=10)  # The file can be downloaded up to 10 times (requires a paid plan).
> fileio.upload(filepath, auto_delete=True)  # The file will not be automatically deleted after it expires or reaches max_downloads (requires a paid plan).
> 
> # The response is a dictionary containing information about the uploaded file.
> resp = fileio.upload(filepath)
> success = resp['success']  # True if upload was successful
> status = resp['status']  # HTTP status code
> key = resp['key']  # ID of uploaded file
> link = resp['link']  # Link to file (not a direct link)
> ```

### Download
You can download the file from file.io without authentication. Notice that each file can only be downloaded once by default and will be automatically deleted afterwards, regardless of whether you authenticate or not. The maximum number of downloads allowed for a file is determined by the uploader, and can be increased with a paid account.
> #### Download Declaration: 
> ```python
> Fileio.download(key[, file])
> fileio.download(key[, file])
> ```
> #### Download Parameter
> | Parameter | Description                  | Default |
> | --------- | ---------------------------- | ------- |
> | `key`     | Identity of uploaded file    |         |
> | `file`    | Filepath of file to download | `None`  |
> 
> #### Download Example:
> ```python=
> from fileio_wrapper import Fileio
> 
> fileio_api_key = 'XXXXXXX.XXXXXXX-XXXXXXX-XXXXXXX-XXXXXXX'
> key = 'ZDu1og7rOkJq'
> 
> # Download without Authentication
> Fileio.download(key)
> 
> # Download with Authentication
> # > Assuming the uploaded file is named "original_name.txt"
> fileio = Fileio(fileio_api_key)
> fileio.downlaod(key)  # Raw-Byte in key 'content'
> fileio.downlaod(key, '')  # Raw-Byte in key 'content'
> fileio.download(key, "folder")  # Download to ./filder/original_name.txt
> fileio.download(key, "assigned_name.txt")  # Download to ./assigned_name.txt
> 
> # Response is dict of downloaded file information if file parameter is assigned.
> resp = fileio.download(key, "folder")
> success = resp['success']  # True if upload was successful
> status = resp['status']  # HTTP status code
> key = resp['key']  # ID of uploaded file
> path = resp['path']  # Directory of downloaded file located
> name = resp['name']  # Filename of Downloaded file
> ```

### Update
Update an uploaded file by providing its key and modifying its attributes, such as the expiration date, maximum number of downloads, or even the file itself associated with the key. Authenticate is needed to call the method.

> from fileio_wrapper import Fileio
> 
> fileio_api_key = 'XXXXXXX.XXXXXXX-XXXXXXX-XXXXXXX-XXXXXXX'
> filepath = './file.txt'
> 
> fileio = Fileio(fileio_api_key)
> 
> # Update file to another only
> fileio.update(key, file=filepath)
> fileio.update(key, file=filepath, mode='replace_partial')
> 
> ## Update expiration date only
> fileio.upload(key, expires=None)  # The file never expires (requires a paid plan).

> 
> # Update all fields at once. 
> # If a field is not assigned a value, the default value will be used.
> fileio.update(key, file=filepath, mode='replace_all')  # Default: expires='14d', max_downloads=1, auto_delete=True
> fileio.update(key, max_download=1)  # The API returned an error response. Since this mode requires updating all fields, the file parameter is mandatory.
> 
> # Response is dict of uploaded file information after update
> resp = fileio.update(filepath)
> success = resp['success']  # True if upload was successful
> status = resp['status']  # HTTP status code
> key = resp['key']  # ID of uploaded file
