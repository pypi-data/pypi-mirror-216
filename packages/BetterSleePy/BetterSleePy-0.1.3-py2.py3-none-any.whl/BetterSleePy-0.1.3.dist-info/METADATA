BetterSleePy
============

Makes the Python sleep module easier a bit.

Installation
============

::

   pip3 install bettersleepy

Usage
=====

I recommend importing it as wait to make it shorter.

Seconds:

::

   import bettersleepy as wait

   wait.sec(1)
   print("Waited 1 second.")

Minutes:

::

   import bettersleepy as wait

   wait.min(1)
   print("Waited 1 minute.")

Hours:

::

   import bettersleepy as wait

   wait.hour(1)
   print("Waited 1 hour.")
