## Structure of repo
This repo is divided into 3 separate packages -: core, tensorflow, pytorch.

- Core - Provides base functionality, no dependency on Tensorflow or Pytorch required.
- Tensorflow - Provides Tensorflow-specific functionalities, and converters based on Tensorflow-logics.
- PyTorch - Provides PyTorch-specific functionalities, and converters based on PyTorch-logics.

## Installation
The library provides a base package and extras for export functionalities that require specific dependencies -:

- ```pip install czmodel``` - This would only install base dependencies, no Tensorflow-/Pytorch-specific packages.
- ```pip install czmodel[tensorflow]``` - This would install base and Tensorflow-specific packages.
- ```pip install czmodel[pytorch]``` - This would install base and Pytorch-specific packages.

## System setup
The current version of this toolbox only requires a fresh Python 3.x installation. 
It was tested with Python 3.7 on Windows.

## Model conversion
The toolbox provides a `convert` module that features all supported conversion strategies. It currently supports 
converting Keras / PyTorch models in memory or stored on disk with a corresponding metadata JSON file (see _CZANN Model Specification_ below).

### Keras / PyTorch models in memory
The toolbox also provides functionality that can be imported e.g. in the training script used to fit a Keras / PyTorch model. 
It provides different converters to target specific versions of the export format. Currently, there are two converters available:
- DefaultConverter: Exports a .czann file complying with the specification below.
- LegacyConverter (Only for segmentation): Exports a .czmodel file (version 3.1.0 of the legacy ANN-based segmentation models in ZEN).

The converters are accessible by running:

For Keras model:
```python
from czmodel.tensorflow.convert import DefaultConverter, LegacyConverter
```
For PyTorch model:
```python
from czmodel.pytorch.convert import DefaultConverter, LegacyConverter
```

Every converter provides a `convert_from_model_spec` function that uses a model specification object to convert a model 
to the corresponding export format. It accepts a `tensorflow.keras.Model` / `torch.nn.Module` that will be exported to [ONNX](https://onnx.ai/) (For Keras model, in case of failure it will be exported to [SavedModel](https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/saved_model))
format and at the same time wrapped into a .czann/.czmodel file that can be imported and used by Intellesis.  
To provide the meta data, the toolbox provides a ModelSpec class that must be filled with the model, a ModelMetadata 
instance containing the information required by the specification (see _Model Metadata_ below), and optionally a license file. 

A CZANN/CZMODEL can be created from a Keras / PyTorch model with the following three steps.

#### 1. Create a model meta data class
To export a CZANN, meta information is needed that must be provided through a `ModelMetadata` instance.

For segmentation:

```python
from czmodel.core.model_metadata import ModelMetadata, ModelType

model_metadata = ModelMetadata(
    input_shape=[1024, 1024, 3],
    output_shape=[1024, 1024, 5],
    model_type=ModelType.SINGLE_CLASS_SEMANTIC_SEGMENTATION,
    classes=["class1", "class2", "class3", "class4", "class5"],
    model_name="ModelName",
    min_overlap=[90, 90]
)
```
For regression:

```python
from czmodel.core.model_metadata import ModelMetadata, ModelType

model_metadata = ModelMetadata(
    input_shape=[1024, 1024, 3],
    output_shape=[1024, 1024, 3],
    model_type=ModelType.REGRESSION,
    model_name="ModelName",
    min_overlap=[90, 90]
)
```
For legacy CZMODEL models the legacy `ModelMetadata` must be used:

```python
from czmodel.core.legacy_model_metadata import ModelMetadata as LegacyModelMetadata

model_metadata_legacy = LegacyModelMetadata(
    name="Simple_Nuclei_SegmentationModel_Legacy",
    classes=["class1", "class2"],
    pixel_types="Bgr24",
    color_handling="ConvertToMonochrome",
    border_size=90,
)
``` 

#### 2 .Creating a model specification
The model and its corresponding metadata are now wrapped into a ModelSpec object.

```python
from czmodel.tensorflow.model_spec import ModelSpec # for czmodel[tensorflow]
#from czmodel.pytorch.model_spec import ModelSpec   # for czmodel[pytorch]

model_spec = ModelSpec(
    model=model,
    model_metadata=model_metadata,
    license_file="C:\\some\\path\\to\\a\\LICENSE.txt"
)
```
The corresponding model spec for legacy models is instantiated analogously.

```python
from czmodel.tensorflow.legacy_model_spec import ModelSpec as LegacyModelSpec  # for czmodel[tensorflow]
#from czmodel.pytorch.legacy_model_spec import ModelSpec as LegacyModelSpec    # for czmodel[pytorch]

legacy_model_spec = LegacyModelSpec(
    model=model,
    model_metadata=model_metadata_legacy,
    license_file="C:\\some\\path\\to\\a\\LICENSE.txt"
)
```

#### 3. Converting the model
The actual model conversion is finally performed with the ModelSpec object and the output path and name of the CZANN.

```python
from czmodel.tensorflow.convert import DefaultConverter as TensorflowDefaultConverter  # for czmodel[tensorflow]

TensorflowDefaultConverter().convert_from_model_spec(model_spec=model_spec, output_path='some/path', output_name='some_file_name')


from czmodel.pytorch.convert import DefaultConverter as PytorchDefaultConverter  # for czmodel[pytorch]

PytorchDefaultConverter().convert_from_model_spec(model_spec=model_spec, output_path='some/path', output_name='some_file_name', input_shape=(3, 1024, 1024))

```
For legacy models the interface is similar.

```python
from czmodel.tensorflow.convert import LegacyConverter as TensorflowDefaultConverter  # for czmodel[tensorflow]

TensorflowDefaultConverter().convert_from_model_spec(model_spec=legacy_model_spec, output_path='some/path',       
                                          output_name='some_file_name')


from czmodel.pytorch.convert import LegacyConverter as PytorchLegacyConverter  # for czmodel[pytorch]

PytorchLegacyConverter().convert_from_model_spec(model_spec=legacy_model_spec, output_path='some/path',
                                          output_name='some_file_name', input_shape=(3, 1024, 1024))
```

### Exported TensorFlow / PyTorch models
Not all TensorFlow / PyTorch models can be converted. You can convert a model exported from TensorFlow / PyTorch if the model and the 
provided meta data comply with the _CZANN Model Specification_ below.

The actual conversion is triggered by either calling:

```python
from czmodel.tensorflow.convert import DefaultConverter as TensorflowDefaultConverter  # for czmodel[tensorflow]

TensorflowDefaultConverter().convert_from_json_spec('Path to JSON file', 'Output path', 'Model Name')


from czmodel.pytorch.convert import DefaultConverter as PytorchDefaultConverter  # for czmodel[pytorch]

PytorchDefaultConverter().convert_from_json_spec('Path to JSON file', 'Output path', (3, 1024, 1024), 'Model Name')
```
or by using the command line interface of the `savedmodel2czann` script (only for Keras model):
```console
savedmodel2ann path/to/model_spec.json output/path/ output_name --license_file path/to/license_file.txt
```

### Adding pre- and post-processing layers (only for Keras model)
Both, `convert_from_json_spec` and `convert_from_model_spec` in the converter classes accept the 
following optional parameters:
- `spatial_dims`: Set new spatial dimensions for the new input node of the model. This parameter is expected to contain the new height 
and width in that order. **Note:** The spatial input dimensions can only be changed in ANN architectures that are invariant to the 
spatial dimensions of the input, e.g. FCNs.
- `preprocessing`: One or more pre-processing layers that will be prepended to the deployed model. A pre-processing 
layer must be derived from the `tensorflow.keras.layers.Layer` class.
- `postprocessing`: One or more post-processing layers that will be appended to the deployed model. A post-processing 
layer must be derived from the `tensorflow.keras.layers.Layer` class.

While ANN models are often trained on images in RGB(A) space, the ZEN infrastructure requires models inside a CZANN to 
expect inputs in BGR(A) color space. This toolbox offers pre-processing layers to convert the color space before 
passing the input to the model to be actually deployed. The following code shows how to add a BGR to RGB conversion layer 
to a model and set its spatial input dimensions to 512x512.

```python
from czmodel.tensorflow.util.transforms import TransposeChannels
from czmodel.tensorflow.convert import DefaultConverter

# Define dimensions and pre-processing
spatial_dims = 512, 512  # Optional: Target spatial dimensions of the model
preprocessing = [TransposeChannels(order=(2, 1,
                                          0))]  # Optional: Pre-Processing layers to be prepended to the model. Can be a single layer, a list of layers or None.
postprocessing = None  # Optional: Post-Processing layers to be appended to the model. Can be a single layer, a list of layers or None.

# Perform conversion
DefaultConverter().convert_from_model_spec(
    model_spec=model_spec,
    output_path='some/path',
    output_name='some_file_name',
    spatial_dims=spatial_dims,
    preprocessing=preprocessing,
    postprocessing=postprocessing
)
```

Additionally, the toolbox offers a `SigmoidToSoftmaxScores` layer that can be appended through the `postprocessing` parameter to convert 
the output of a model with sigmoid output activation to the output that would be produced by an equivalent model with softmax activation.


### Unpacking CZANN/CZSEG files
The czmodel library offers functionality to unpack existing CZANN/CZSEG models. For a given .czann or .czseg model it is possible to extract the underlying ANN model to a specified folder and retrieve the corresponding meta-data as instances of the meta-data classes defined in the czmodel library.

For CZANN files:

```python
from czmodel.tensorflow.convert import DefaultConverter  # for czmodel[tensorflow]
#from czmodel.pytorch.convert import DefaultConverter    # for czmodel[pytorch]
from pathlib import Path

model_metadata, model_path = DefaultConverter().unpack_model(model_file='Path of the .czann file',
                                                             target_dir=Path('Output Path'))
```

For CZSEG/CZMODEL files:

```python
from czmodel.tensorflow.convert import LegacyConverter  # for czmodel[tensorflow]
#from czmodel.pytorch.convert import DefaultConverter   # for czmodel[pytorch]
from pathlib import Path

model_metadata, model_path = LegacyConverter().unpack_model(model_file='Path of the .czseg/.czann file',
                                                            target_dir=Path('Output Path'))
```


## CZANN Model Specification
This section specifies the requirements for an artificial neural network (ANN) model and the additionally required metadata to enable execution of the model inside the ZEN Intellesis infrastructure starting with ZEN blue >=3.2 and ZEN Core >3.0.  

The model format currently allows to bundle models for semantic segmentation, instance segmentation, object detection, classification and regression and is defined as a ZIP archive with the file extension .czann containing the following files with the respective filenames:
- JSON Meta data file. (filename: model.json)
- Model in ONNX/TensorFlow SavedModel format. In case of  SavedModel format the folder representing the model must be zipped to a single file. (filename: model.model)
- Optionally: A license file for the contained model. (filename: license.txt)

The meta data file must comply with the following specification:

```json
