v0.5.1 (?)
----------


API changes
###########

* Unify API for constant sized objects and sizing of investment. For both, `Flow` and
  `GenericStorage`, the argument `investment` is now deprecated. Instead,
  `nominal_value` and `nominal_storage_capacity` accept an `Investment` object.
* Change investment for experimental :class:`oemof.solph.components.experimental._sink_dsm.SinkDSM`: Remove
  obsolete parameters `flex_share_down` and `flex_share_up`.
* Mainline link component :class:`oemof.solph.components._link.Link` from experimental.

New features
############

* Add option to run multi-period (dynamic) investment models with oemof.solph as an experimental feature:
    * You can change from standard model to multi-period model by defining the newly introduced `periods`
      attribute of your energy system. Be aware that it is experimental as of now. `periods` is a dictionary
      mapping the periods you want to model (usually years) to pandas.date_range objects.
    * Add attributes `periods` to :class:`oemof.solph._energy_system.EnergySystem`.
    * Introduce new Pyomo Sets `PERIODS` and `TIMEINDEX` in :class:`oemof.solph.models.Model`.
    * Index all investment-related variables with `PERIODS` and flow variable with `TIMEINDEX`, which
      is a tuple of periods and timesteps.
    * Add lifetime tracking for investment options by introducing the attributes `lifetime` and `age`.
    * Add new investment-related variables `total` holding the total capacity, `old` holding capacity
      to be decommissioned, `old_exo` (for exogenous) holding existing capacity to be decommissioned and
      `old_end` holding model-endogenously installed capacity to be decommissioned after its lifetime.
    * Include discounting and calculating annuities in the objective function terms. Introduce attribute `discount_rate`
      of :class:`oemof.solph.models.Model` and `interest_rate` for individual investment objects (options.Investment).
* Add `storage_level_constraint` that allows to set flows from/to storage (in)active based on storage content.

Documentation
#############

* See extensive documentation in user guide and API reference for the new (experimental) multi-period feature.
* Be more strict about about oemof (meta package) oemof.solph (this package).

Bug fixes
#########

* Fixed error when calling `oemof_installation_test` as console script.
* Corrected several typos in the docs.

Testing
#######

* Add tests for experimental SinkDSM component.
