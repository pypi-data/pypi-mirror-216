# Run Pluto.jl on a JupyterHub

[![Latest PyPI version](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/jupyter-pluto-proxy?logo=pypi)](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/jupyter-pluto-proxy)

Launch the awesome [Pluto.jl Notebook](https://plutojl.org/) from the
Jupyter Lab `Launcher` or the Jupyter Classic `New` dropdown. This
package was built using the [`jupyter-server-proxy` cookiecutter
template](https://github.com/illumidesk/cookiecutter-jupyter-server-proxy).

This is primarily for use with
[JupyterHub](https://github.com/jupyterhub/jupyterhub) in container
based environments.

Based on [original repo from Illumidesk](https://github.com/IllumiDesk/jupyter-pluto-proxy).
