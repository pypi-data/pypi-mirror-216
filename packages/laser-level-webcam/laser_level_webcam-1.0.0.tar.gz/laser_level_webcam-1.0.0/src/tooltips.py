increase the number of samples to ~100 and the outliers to ~50%. In more controlled environments
outliers of 20% is good. High subsamples that are over 100-200 haven`t shown to be a benefit from my testing."""

Smoothing can also be helpful if your laser white center is being clipped and doesn`t

back the peak giving the mid point detector a better chance of finding the center.

Warning:
If you are smoothing by a high value and the luminosity view is showing that it's
coming off the view, it might skew the resulting value. It is generally best to use
a small amount of smoothing and only use large amounts in special cases like this. """
