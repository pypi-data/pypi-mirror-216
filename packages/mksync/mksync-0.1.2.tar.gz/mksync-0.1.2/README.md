# mksync

MkSync replaces directives in a Markdown file with corresponding content. It's a useful tool to add nice
features to your project's `README.md` file, such as a table of contents, without the manual upkeep.

<!-- table of contents -->
* [Example](#example)
* [Available Directives](#available-directives)
* [Synopsis](#synopsis)
<!-- end table of contents -->

## Example

Say this is your `README.md`:

```md
# My Project

<!-- toc -->

## Installation

## Documentation
```

Then running `mksync README.md` will update the file in-place to:

```md
# My Project

<!-- toc -->
* [Installation](#installation)
* [Documentation](#documentation)
<!-- end toc -->

## Installation

## Documentation
```

## Available Directives

* `toc` or `table of contents`: Produce an unordered list of links to all headers in the document after the directive.
* `include <path>`: Include the contents of the file at the given path. You can optionally specify a language name to
  wrap the content in a code block, e.g. `include code:python <path>`.
* `runcmd <command>`: Run the given command and include the output in the document. You can optionally specify a
  language name to wrap the output in a code block, e.g. `runcmd code:python <command>`.
