    """Puts together all Spark features used in ETL jobs in AWS.

    This class provides an easy and fast way for users to improve and
    enhance the development of their Spark applications. The class makes it
    possible through a series of features (attributes and methods) specially
    coded for making the development journey something really simple and fun.

    According to the AWS service to be used by the user to run their Spark
    application, this class can be configured through its "mode" attribute.
    Technically, it means that the "mode" attribute literally handles all
    class inheritance processes based on target AWS service to be used.

    So, users can have available special attributes and methods for improving
    their development process wherever they are creating a Spark application
    for running on AWS Glue, Amazon EMR or even locally.

    Example: A basic usage example of class `SparkETLManager` with mode="glue"
        ```python

                "transformation_ctx": "dyf_orders"
            },
            "customers": {
                "database": "ra8",
                "table_name": "customers",
                "transformation_ctx": "dyf_customers",

        }

        # Creating a class object on initializing a glue job
        spark_manager = SparkETLManager(

    Args:
        mode (string):
            Operation mode for the class. It handles inheritance from other
            classes based on this library so the `SparkETLManager` class can
            expand its features for a Spark application development in
            specific scenarios.
            Acceptable values are: "glue", "emr", "local".

    Tip: The "mode" attribute may not be the only one
        By its own construction, the class `SparkETLManager`inherits attributes
        and methods from other classes in the library. It means that these
        other classes may have its own attributes to be passed on class
        construction.

        For example, when users choose to set the Glue operation mode
        (`mode="glue"`) on starting up the class `SparkETLManager`, a class
        inheritance from `GlueJobManager` is set under the hood. Because of
        that, attributes like `argv_list` and `data_dict` must be passed
        together with `mode` as they are mandatory on `GlueJobManager` class
        construction.

        For a special tip, check the construction of the class to be inherited
        based on mode operation to see which attributes are necessary to pass
        at `SparkETLManager` class start up.

        This method makes it possible to extract multiple date attributes from
        a column in a Spark DataFrame that represents a date or timestamp
        information. To do that, the given date column in the DataFrame should
        be of types DATE, TIMESTAMP. There is a special case where the target
        date column is of STRING data type. In that situtation, the column
        must be parseable as a date so the date attributes can be extracted
        from it.

        The method logic is made for a initial field casting validation
        followed by the extraction of all date attributes according to the user
        input on the method call. The big idea behing this features is the
        ability to provide users a huge DataFrame enrichment with a single
        method call to improve their analytics processes.

            In order to provide a new feature that is capable to put together
            the extraction of multiple statistical attributes with a single
            line of code, a special list of pyspark functions were selected
            as acceptable functions to be called on the aggregation process.

            It means that if users wants to apply an aggregation on the
            target DataFrame and extract the sum, the mean, the minimum and
            the maximum value of a given numeric column, they must pass
            keyword arguments as following: `sum=True`, `mean=True`,
            `min=True` and `max=True`.

            All acceptable keyword arguments (pyspark functions) can be
            found right below:

            sum (bool): Extracts the sum of a given numeric column

        This method is responsible for adding a new column on a target Spark

        new column to the DataFrame using a name for the partition column
        (partition_name) and its value (partition_value).

        Examples
            ```python

        """Repartitioning a Spark DataFrame for optimizing storage.

        This method applies the repartition process in a Spark DataFrame in
        order to optimize its storage on S3. The method has some important
        checks based on each pyspark method to use for repartitioning the
        DataFrame. Take a look at the below tip to learn more.

        Tip: Additional details on method behavior
            The method `repartition_dataframe()` works as follows:

            1. The current number of partitions in the target DataFrame
            is checked
            2. The desired number of partitions passed as a parameter
            is checked

            * If the desired number is LESS than the current number, then the
            method `coalesce()` is executed
            * If the desired number is GREATER than the current one, then the
            method `repartition()` is executed

        Examples:
            ```python
            # Repartitioning a Spark DataFrame
            df_repartitioned = spark_manager.repartition_dataframe(
