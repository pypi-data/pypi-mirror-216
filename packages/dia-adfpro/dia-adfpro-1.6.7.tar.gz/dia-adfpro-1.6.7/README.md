Fast means processes that are repeated continuously on manufacturing equipments and have a duration of a few seconds.

Repository includes 2 modules:
1) used from ML frameworks running on the cloud (Domino, SageMaker, AzureML) to trigger model training and classification on datasets having a certain structure;
2) used to implement Dash dashboards to visualize results
