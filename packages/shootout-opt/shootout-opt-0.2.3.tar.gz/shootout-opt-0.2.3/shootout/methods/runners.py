    This function is the main ingredient of shootout. It is a decorator, to run a python function ``my_script`` with a set of inputs to grid on. The outputs are stored in a pandas DataFrame which is stored locally.
    
    Shootout is designed to make optimization algorithms comparison easier, so the target application is to lift up a code comparing algorithms on single parameter settings to a full comparison and storing all parameters and results.

    A few restrictions are placed on the wrapped function:

        - outputs is one dictionary
        - the errors, timings and any other algorithm dependent quantity must be inside lists of length the number of algorithms.

    In single_method mode, 2. is not applied. We allow the user to simply provide anything that will be added as an object to the df.

    A toy example:

    >>> @run_and_track(nb_seeds=5, n=[5,10], m=[4,8])
    >>> def my_script(n=7, m=9, p=12):
    >>>     return { "something": n+m+p }

    will return a dataframe containing four columns ``n`` , ``m`` , ``something`` and ``seed`` , with 5x2x2 rows (5 runs which are here exactly the same, two values for n and two values for m).    
    Note that the function should output a dictionary.

    **Syntax:**
    In the case of a single algorithm to run with several hyperparameters, the syntax looks like this:
    
    >>> @run_and_track(algorithm_names=['My favorite Algorithm'], hyperparameter=[0.1,1,10], seed=[1,15,975])
    >>> def my_script(n=10, m=10, hyperparameter=0, seed=0):
    >>>     # some random generation using seed, e.g. with numpy randomstate
    >>>     # seed will be populated by numbers in the seed list
    >>>     # and hyperparameter with 0.1, 1 and 10
    >>>     errors, timings, anything_else = my_algorithm(random_data,n,m,hyperparameter)
    >>>     return {"errors": errors, "timings": timings}
    
    where errors and timings must have the same length.
    
    For several algorithms, say two, the syntax for the returns of ``my_script`` function is similar but slightly different:
    
    >>> @run_and_track(algorithm_names=['My Favorite Algorithm', 'my annoying competitor'], seed=[1,17,597], hyperparameter=[0.1,1,10])
    >>> def my_script(n=10, m=10, hyperparameter=0, seed=0):
    >>>     # some random generation using seed, e.g. with numpy randomstate
    >>>     # seed will be populated by numbers from 0 to nb_seeds
    >>>     # and hyperparameter with 0.1, 1 and 10
    >>>     errors, timings, anything_else = my_algorithm(random_data,n,m,hyperparameter)
    >>>     errors2, timings2, anything_else2 = my_competitor(random_data,n,m,hyperparameter)
    >>>     return {"errors": [errors, errors2], "timings": [timings, timings2]}

    The naming of the inputs and outputs is completely free. However, naming errors/loss/utility collected in a list exactly ``errors`` and ``timings`` (time starting from 0) will allow for immediate processing with utilities from shootout such as plotting convergence curves.

    The recommended syntax when many parameters are involved is to define all the parameters in a dictionary, see ``**kwa`` below. For the signature of the inner function, one should also use a dictionary with the same keys.

    Parameters
    ----------
    **kwa: dictionary, optional
        A dictionary containing all the elements in the signature of the function to run. Typically use in the following fashion:

        >>> vars = dict(
        >>>     {
        >>>         "n": [10,15],
        >>>         "m": [25,30],
        >>>         "noise": 0.25,
        >>>         "r": 3,
        >>>         "seed": [1,2,3,4]
        >>>     }
        >>> )
        >>> @run_and_track(**vars)
        >>> def myalgorithm(**v):
        >>>     xxx = v["n"] + ...
        
        Another syntax is tolerated although not recommended, where the user may mismatch the signatures of "@run_and_track" and the ran function as such:

        >>> @run_and_track(n=[10,15], m=[25,30], noise=0.25, add_track={"mytrack":[7,12,20]}, name_store="test-df", nb_seeds=2, algorithm_names=["method1"])
        >>> def myalgorithm(n=10,m=20,r=3,random=True,noise=0.5):
        >>>     ...

        the entries in run_and_track must then be repeated in the function to be run. Note that both methods cannot be combined, so as to promote the use of the first method which is cleaner (all function parameters used for the run will be stored and the variables are not duplicated).
        By default None.
    add_track : dictionary, optional
        a dictionary of values to store manually. The inputs and outputs are stored anyway so this option should be avoided if possible. By default None
    algorithm_names : list, optional
        provide a list of name for each algorithm that will be run in the script. The names should match the outputs of the script if the outputs are lists (same size and order). Using this input is recommended for easily naming plots in post-processing stages. By default None
    path_store : string, optional
        the path (relative or absolute) to the directory where the DataFrame will be stored, by default None, and default directory is the current working directory.
    name_store : string, optional
        name of the file containing the DataFrame, by default None and the default name is the date in long format.
    verbose : bool, optional
        choose wether run_and_track prints its progress, by default True
    skip : bool, optional
        Set to True to skip computations, by default False.
