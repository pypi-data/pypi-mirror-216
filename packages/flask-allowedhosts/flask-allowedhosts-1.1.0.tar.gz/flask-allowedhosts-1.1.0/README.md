# Flask Allowed Hosts

Flask Allowed Hosts is a Flask extension that provides host validation for API endpoints. It allows you to enforce that requests are only accepted from specific hosts, providing an additional layer of security for your Flask application.

## Installation

Install the package using pip:

```cmd
pip install flask-allowedhosts
```

## Getting Started

1. Import the check_host decorator from flask_allowedhosts:

```python
from flask import Flask, request, jsonify
from flask_allowedhosts import check_host
```

2. Create a Flask application instance:

```python
app = Flask(__name__)
```

3. Define the list of allowed hosts:

```python
ALLOWED_HOSTS = ['127.0.0.1', 'localhost']
```

4. Apply the `@check_host` decorator to the desired endpoint(s):

```python
@app.route("/api")
@check_host(allowed_hosts=ALLOWED_HOSTS)
def greet_endpoint():
    name = request.args.get("name", "Friend")
    greeting = {"greeting": f"Hello There {name}!"}
    return jsonify(greeting), 200
```

*The default value for `allowed_hosts` is an empty list, which means requests from all hosts are allowed.*

5. Run the Flask application:

```python
from flask import Flask, request, jsonify
from flask_allowedhosts import check_host

app = Flask(__name__)

ALLOWED_HOSTS = ['127.0.0.1', 'localhost']

@app.route("/api")
@check_host(allowed_hosts=ALLOWED_HOSTS)
def greet_endpoint():
    name = request.args.get("name", "Friend")
    greeting = {"greeting": f"Hello There {name}!"}
    return jsonify(greeting), 200


if __name__ == '__main__':
  app.run(host='0.0.0.0', port=5000)
```

Now only the allowed hosts can access the protected endpoint(s). Requests from other hosts will receive a 403 Forbidden error.
