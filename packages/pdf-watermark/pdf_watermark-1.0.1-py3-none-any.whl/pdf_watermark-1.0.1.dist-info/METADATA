# pdf-watermark

A python CLI tool to add watermarks to a PDF. Support for bulk processing of multiple PDF files, with nice saving options.

## Description

There are multiple similar tools out there but I couldn't find one that really suited my needs. This project also serves as an excuse to play with building and distributing a python CLI tool.

With this tool you can add a watermark to a PDF file. The watermark can either be a text string that you provide, or an image (PNG being the recommanded format). The watermark is repeated multiple times on each page.

Below this is an example of a PDF before using this tool, after using this tool with a text watermark, and after using this tool with an image watermark.

</p>

You can control the opacity of the watermark and its inclination. You can also control the number of repetitions along the horizontal and vertical directions, as well as wether to leave a margin around the page or not.

There are also specific options for text and image watermarks. For text watermarks, you can control the color, font and font size. For image watermarks, you can add a scale factor (by default, the image is scaled to fit nicely in the rectangles created by the horizontal and vertical repetitions).

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

* This project was built with python 3.11. However it should also run just fine with older versions.
* See `requirements.txt` for the list of dependencies.

### Installing

This package is available on PyPi.

```
pip install pdf-watermark
```

### Usage

```
Usage: watermark [OPTIONS] FILE WATERMARK

  Add a WATERMARK to one or more PDF files referenced by FILE. WATERMARK can
  be either a string or a path to an image file. FILE can be a single file or
  a directory, in which case all PDF files in the directory will be
  watermarked.

Options:
  -s, --save TEXT                 File or folder to save results to. By
                                  default, the input files are overwritten.
  -o, --opacity FLOAT             Watermark opacity between 0 (invisible) and
                                  1 (no transparency).
  -a, --angle FLOAT               Watermark inclination in degrees.
  -h, --horizontal-boxes INTEGER  Number of repetitions of the watermark along
                                  the horizontal direction.
  -v, --vertical-boxes INTEGER    Number of repetitions of the watermark along
                                  the vertical direction.
  -m, --margin BOOLEAN            Wether to leave a margin around the page or
                                  not. When False (default), the watermark
                                  will be cut on the PDF edges.
  -tc, --text-color TEXT          Text color in hexadecimal format, e.g.
                                  #000000.
  -tf, --text-font TEXT           Text font to use. Supported fonts are those
                                  supported by reportlab.
  -ts, --text-size INTEGER        Text font size.
  -is, --image-scale FLOAT        Scale factor for the image. Note that before
                                  this factor is applied, the image is already
                                  scaled down to fit in the boxes.
  --help                          Show this message and exit.
