Creating a project
===================

Here is how to create a ``srsgui`` project as shown in the example
directory.

    - Create file structure for a project.
    - Make a list of instrument classes and Python scripts in a .taskconfig file.
    - Define instrument drivers based on the :class:`Instrument<srsgui.inst.instrument.Instrument>` class
    - Write Python scripts based on the :class:`Task<srsgui.task.task.Task>` class.
    - Open the configuration file in the ``srsgui`` application
    - Connect instruments from the Instruments menu, if connections not defined
      in the configuration file.
    - Select a task from the Task menu and run it.


Creating file structure for a project
------------------------------------------

Each ``srsgui`` project makes a use of the predefined directory structure.

.. code-block::

    /Project root directory
        /instruments
        /tasks
        project.taskconfig

A project directory has a .taskconfig configuration file and multiple Python
modules in two special subdirectory: instruments and tasks.
Whenever open a .taskconfig file from the SRSGUI application,
Python modules in those directories will be forced to reload.

Typically, a Python interpreter loads a module when it is imported for the first time,
and never check again if the module is modified. When you make changes to a module, save it,
and run a script using it, you would not see the changes because the Python interpreter
would not use the modified module, as long as the previous copy of the module is in memory.
The Python interpreter needs to restart to take an effect of the changed modules.

When you open a .taskconfig file again from the ``srsgui`` application,
it reloads all the Python modules in the 2 subdirectories.
It helps when you modify and debug a module in the subdirectories.
Instead of restart the application every time a module is changed,
you can reopen the .taskconfig file to see the changes from modified modules.
If you modify a Python module other than the ones in the 2 directories
with respect to the current .taskconfig file, you have to restart the ``srsgui`` application
to use the modified module.

Python does not allow to use spaces in its package and module names.
Use underscore if you need spaces between words.


Populating the .taskconfig file
-----------------------------------

Each ``srsgui`` project has a \.taskconfig file. The configuration file
contains:

    - name of the project,
    - a list of instruments to use
    - a list tasks to run


The following is the configuration file in the example directory
of ``srsgui`` package without comment lines.

.. code-block::

    name: srsgui example project using an oscilloscope and a clock generator

    inst: cg,  instruments.cg635,   CG635
    inst: osc, instruments.sds1202, SDS1202

    task: *IDN test,    tasks.first,  FirstTask
    task: Plot example, tasks.second, SecondTask
    ...


The keyword 'name:' is use as

    - Title of the SRSGUI application main window (Look at the top of
      this :ref:`screen capture <top-of-screen-capture-1>`.
    - Directory name for the project data saving under ~/home/task-results

You can specify a list of instrument classes to be included in the project using 'inst:' keyword.
The first column after the keyword is the name of the instrument used across the project:

    - Menu items under **Instruments** menu. It is used to connect and disconnect
      the selected instrument.
    - Tab labels in Instrument Info panel (in the top left corner under the red STOP button
      in this :ref:`screen capture <top-of-screen-capture-1>`.
    - Name used in terminal to specify a instrument. Make it short if you use a lot
      in the terminal at the bottom right corner in this
      :ref:`screen capture <top-of-screen-capture-1>`.

    - Argument in :meth:`get_instrument() <srsgui.task.task.Task.get_instrument>` method in
      :class:`Task<srsgui.task.task.Task>` class.

The second column is the path to the module that contains the instrument class.
The path can be relative to the .taskconfig file if it is a local module,

.. code-block::

    inst: cg,  instruments.cg635,   CG635

or a path from one of the Python site_package directory.

.. code-block::

    inst: lia, srsinst.sr860,  SR860

The third column is the name of the class defined in the module.


You can add the optional fourth column if an instrument is used with a fixed connection parameters.

.. code-block::

    inst: cg2,  instruments.cg635,   CG635,   serial:COM4:9600
    inst: osc2, instruments.sds1202, SDS1202, tcpip:192.168.1.100:5035

It gets the instruments connected, while a configuration file is loading.


The first instrument that appears in the configuration file is the default instrument.
When a command is entered from the terminal of the srsgui application, without instrument prefix,
it will be sent to the default instrument.


The keyword 'task:' is used to specify a task class to be used in the configuration file.
the first column after the 'task:' keyword is the name of the task,
the second is path to the module, the third one is the name of the task class.
It specifies a task class in the same way with instrument classes.

When you open a .taskconfig file, in ``srsgui`` application, the names of the tasks
appear as menu items under the Task menu, as shown at the top of
this :ref:`screen capture <top-of-screen-capture-1>`.

You can select one of the task items and run the task.
