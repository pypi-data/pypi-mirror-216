Installation
==============

Preparation
------------

To install ``srsgui``,  make sure you have Python version 3.7 or later.
you can check your Python version by running from the command prompt:

.. code-block::

    python --version

.. note::

    Commands running from the command prompt shown here are assumed using
    a Windows computer system. If you use other systems, commands may be
    different. Refer to `this page. <install-packages_>`_

If you have a Python older than the required version,
`install a newer Python. <install-python_>`_

Using `virtual environment <virtual-environment_>`_ helps to avoid possible dependency
conflicts among Python packages. If you want to use a virtual environment, create one with
your favorite virtual environment package. If you do not have a preference,
use Python default ``venv``.

.. code-block::

    python -m venv env
    .\env\Scripts\activate

.. note::
    Commands to use ``venv`` are different among computer systems. Other than Windows, refer to
    `this page <venv_>`_.

Srsgui installation
--------------------

To run ``srsgui`` as a GUI application, install it with [full] option using pip_:

.. code-block::

    python -m pip install srsgui[full]

It will install ``srsgui`` package along with
the 3 main packages (pyserial_, matplotlib_ and pyside6_) and their dependencies.

If

    - you plan only to use the instrument driver part of ``srsgui`` package without GUI support,
    - your system requires to install matplotlib_ or pyside6_ from sources other than pip
      (Some linux systems do so),
    - you want to use pyqt5_ or pyside2_ instead of pyside6_ as GUI backend,
    - you have trouble with the full installation and you want to install dependency manually,

you can install without the extra [full] option:

.. code-block::

    python -m pip install srsgui

It will install ``srsgui`` with pyserial_ only.

.. note::
    ``srsgui`` runs with either pyside6_, pyside2_ or pyqt5_ installed as GUI backend.
    If your system already have pyside2_ or pyqt5_ installed, you do not have to install pyside6_.

        python -m pip show pyside2

        python -m pip show pyqt5

    will show if pyside2_ or pyqt5_ is installed.

.. note::
    In order to maintain the MIT_ license for your projects or modified ``srsgui``, you have to use
    pyside6_ or pyside2_. Note that pyqt5_ imposes GPLv3_ license to packages using pyqt5_.

Starting srsgui application
----------------------------

After ``srsgui`` is installed, you can start ``srsgui`` application from the command prompt.

.. code-block::

    srsgui

    or

    python -m srsgui

``srsgui`` installs a executable script named "srsgui" in Python/Scripts directory.
If the directory is included in PATH environment variable, **srsgui** command will work.
Otherwise, **python -m srsgui** will work regardless of PATH setting.

.. _top-of-initial-screen-capture:

.. figure:: ./_static/initial-screen-capture.png
    :align: center
    :figclass: align-center

If you see the application is open and running, the installation is successful!

.. note::
    Instead of seeing the application running, you may get errors, probably ImportError.
    Carefully look through the exception traceback to find out which package causes the error.
    When the latest python is installed, some packages may not be installed properly. If the problem
    is not from ``srsgui`` directly, web search of the problem usually leads to a fix.
