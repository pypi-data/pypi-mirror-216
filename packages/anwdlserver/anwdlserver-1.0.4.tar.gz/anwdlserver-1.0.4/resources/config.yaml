  # Server log file path 
  log_file_path: /var/log/anweddol/runtime.txt

  # PID file path for server daemon process
  pid_file_path: /etc/anweddol/daemon_process.pid

  # Live OS image path that will be used by containers 
  container_iso_path: /etc/anweddol/iso/anweddol_container.iso

  # RSA keys root path
  rsa_keys_root_path: /etc/anweddol/rsa_keys

  # Access token database file path
  access_tokens_database_path: /etc/anweddol/credentials/access_token.db

# Contains all nessessary values for container management

  # Numbers of virtual CPUs that are allocated to a container
  container_vcpus: 2

  # NAT interface name that containers will be using to receive
  # server administration. Default is 'virbr0', which is the default 
  # interface created by the libvirtd daemon when launched.
  nat_interface_name: virbr0

  # Bridged interface name that containers will be using to
  # communicate with clients. Default is 'anwdlbr0', which is 
  # an universal interface name. 
  # You can use another interface as long as it permits 
  # containers and clients to communicate.
  bridge_interface_name: anwdlbr0

  # Container endpoint username / password 
  # NOTE : The container endpoint default credentials are public and
  # normalized, that's why they are stored here unencrypted.
