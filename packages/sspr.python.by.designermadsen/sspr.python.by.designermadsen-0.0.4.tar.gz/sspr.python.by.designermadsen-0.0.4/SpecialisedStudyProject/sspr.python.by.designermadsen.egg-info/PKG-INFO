## Summary
Old project that I decided to rewrite in Python. 
The project was originally written is C# and can be found at a previous account I had on 
[Github](https://github.com/KentMadsen/Rybners-SpecialisedStudyProject). 
Which I Since been locked out of.

I decided to make the project to see if I could make the mess more readable 
and also to see what i learned since then.
