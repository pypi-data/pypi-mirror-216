Change Log
===========
0.0.6 (June 29, 2023)
-------------------------
- Sixth Release

Notes:
------
Added a class called linear_std_curve

The class can be used to fit a linear model to data. The class goes beyond standard coefficient determination, as it also
determines estimation limits for inverse regression. Information such as smoothing, baseline subtraction, calibration procedures 
employed to process the data prior to fitting can also be stored.

The prediction band edges of the standard curve are also callable as methods within the object. See documentation for full list of methods
and attributes.
