- Seventh Release

Notes:
------
Added standard curve classes: parabolic_QR, linear_QR, power_std_curve, parabolic_std_curve

The classes can be used to fit models to data. The classes also contain attriburtes such as estimation limits for inverse regression.
Information such as smoothing, baseline subtraction, calibration procedures employed to process the data prior to fitting can also be stored.

The prediction band edges of the standard curve are callable as methods within the objects. See documentation for full list of methods
and attributes.
