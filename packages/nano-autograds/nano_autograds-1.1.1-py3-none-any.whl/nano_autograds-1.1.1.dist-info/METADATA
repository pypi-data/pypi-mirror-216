## Introduction

Nano-AutoGrad is a micro-framework that allows you to build and train neural networks from scratch based on automatic differentiation and computational graphs.

## Installation

You can install Nano-AutoGrad using pip:

```bash
pip install nano-autograds
```

### Features

1. Nano-AutoGrad offers the following features:

    * Automatic Differentiation: Nano-AutoGrad automatically * computes gradients, making it easy to perform gradient-based optimization.
    * Computational Graph Engine: It leverages a computational graph representation to efficiently compute gradients and perform backpropagation.
    * Lightweight and Efficient: Nano-AutoGrad is designed to be lightweight and efficient, suitable for small to medium-sized neural networks.
    * Easy-to-Use API: The framework provides a simple and intuitive API, allowing users to define and train neural networks with ease.
    * Integration with NumPy: Nano-AutoGrad seamlessly integrates with NumPy, enabling efficient array operations and computations.

### Usage

To get started with Nano-AutoGrad, refer to the documentation for detailed usage instructions, examples, and API reference. Here are some basic steps to build and train a neural network using Nano-AutoGrad:
*  examples 1 :

    ```python
    import numpy as np
    import autograd.core.nn as nn
    import autograd.torch.optim as nn

    class MyNeuralNetwork(na.Module):
        def __init__(self):
            self.linear = na.Linear(2, 1)

        def forward(self, x):
            return self.linear(x)

    network = MyNeuralNetwork()
    optimizer = na.SGD(network.parameters(), lr=0.1)

    ```
* Example 2 :
building 'Linear Model' using torch autograd engine 

    ```python  

    import autograd.torch.nn as nn 
    import autograd.torch.tensor as Tensor
    import autograd.torch.optim as SGD
    import autograd.functiona as F

    class Model(nn.Module):
        def __init__(self):
            super().__init__()
            self.l1 = nn.Linear(784, 1568, name='l1')
            self.l2 = nn.Linear(1568, 392, name='l2')
            self.l3 = nn.Linear(392, 10, name='l3')

        def forward(self, x):
            z = F.relu(self.l1(x))
            z = F.relu(self.l2(z))
            out = F.log_softmax(self.l3(z))
            return out

    model = Model()
    optimizer = autograd.optim.SGD(model.parameters(), lr=5e-2, weight_decay=1e-4)
    scheduler = autograd.optim.lr_scheduler.LinearLR(optimizer, start_factor=1.0, end_factor=0.75, total_iters=num_epochs)

    ```
### Examples
