        This is the same as the DropConnect impl I created for EfficientNet, etc networks, however,
        the original name is misleading as 'Drop Connect' is a different form of dropout in a separate paper...
        See discussion: https://github.com/tensorflow/tpu/issues/494#issuecomment-532968956 ... I've opted for
        changing the layer and argument names to 'drop path' rather than mix DropConnect as a layer name and use
        'survival rate' as the argument.
