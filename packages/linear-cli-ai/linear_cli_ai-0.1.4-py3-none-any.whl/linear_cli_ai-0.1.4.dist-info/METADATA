# Configuration

Before using linear-cli-ai, you need to configure a few keys.
You can do this in several ways:

-  Environment variables
-  Config file

The quickest way to get started is to run the ``linear configure`` command:

```
$ linear configure
  Provide the following details : 
   Linear API Token : MY_LINEAR_TOKEN
   OpenAI API Key : MY_OPENAI_KEY
   Select the model you will use : gpt4 or gpt-3.5-turbo-0613

```

To use environment variables, do the following:

```

   $ export LINEAR_TOKEN=<linear_token>
   $ export GPT_MODEL=<gpt_model>
   $ export OPENAI_API_KEY=<openai_api_key>

```

To use a config file, create an INI formatted file like this:

```

  [linear]
  token = <linear_token>
  
  [gpt]
  token = <openai_api_key>
  model = <gpt_model>

```
and place it in ``~/.linear-cli-ai.ini`` (or in ``%UserProfile%\.linear-cli-ai.ini`` on Windows).
