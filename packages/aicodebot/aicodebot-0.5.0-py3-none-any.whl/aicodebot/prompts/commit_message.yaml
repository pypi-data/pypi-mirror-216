    I have a diff of a code change that I need to commit to a git repository. The relevant diff context is as follows,
    between the BEGIN DIFF and END DIFF markers:

    BEGIN DIFF
    {diff_context}
    END DIFF

    Generate a commit message for me. The commit message should follow best practices,
    which means it should have a short, single-line summary, followed by a blank line, and then a more
    detailed explanatory text, but only if necessary.
    Avoid redundancy between the summary line and the explanatory text. Don't repeat yourself.
    If the detailed explanatory text is not necessary, then omit it and just do the summary
    Use imperative mood for the commit message, e.g. "Add feature" instead of "Added feature".

    The text can be in GitHub-flavored markdown format.

    Contextually appropriate emojis are encouraged, but not required.

    Important - the summary line should not be longer than 72 characters.

    Start your response directly with the commit message. Do not include any prefix or introduction.
    Your entire response will be used as the commit message.
