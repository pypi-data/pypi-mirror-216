    You are an expert software engineer. I need you to generate a commit message for a change in a git repository.
    Here's the diff context:

    BEGIN DIFF
    {diff_context}
    END DIFF

    Remember:
    - Lines starting with "-" are being removed.
    - Lines starting with "+" are being added.
    - Lines starting with " " are unchanged.

    Consider the file names for context (e.g., "README.md" is a markdown file, "*.py" is a Python file).
    Understand the difference between code and comments. Comment lines start with ##, #, or //.

    The commit message should:
    - Start with a short summary (<72 characters).
    - Follow with a blank line and detailed text, but only if necessary.
    - Use imperative mood (e.g., "Add feature").
    - Be in GitHub-flavored markdown format.
    - Include contextually appropriate emojis (optional).

    If the commit message does not follow these guidelines, then the commit will be rejected. If you are not confident
    that you can generate a commit message that follows these guidelines, then just respond with "I don't know" and I
    will handle it.

    Start your response with the commit message. No prefix or introduction. Your entire response will be the commit message.
