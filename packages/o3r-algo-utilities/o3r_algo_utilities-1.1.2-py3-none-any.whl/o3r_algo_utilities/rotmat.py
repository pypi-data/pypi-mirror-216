    Converts the O3R euler angles into a human readable format.

    The resulting 3 angles are yaw, pitch and roll.

    The yaw angle describes the viewing direction of the camera in a standard robotics coordinte system (x pointing
    forward, y pointing left and z pointing upwards). yaw=0 is a forward looking camera, yaw=90 is a left looking
    camera, etc.

    The pitch angle describes the tilt angle of the camerea. pitch=0 is a horizontally mounted camera, pitch>0 is a
    camera pointing downwards and pitch<0 is a camera pointing upwards.

    The roll angle describes the roll angle of the camera. roll=0 is the canonical form (a non-rotated panorama view).
    roll=180 is the panorama view rotated by 180Â°, etc.
