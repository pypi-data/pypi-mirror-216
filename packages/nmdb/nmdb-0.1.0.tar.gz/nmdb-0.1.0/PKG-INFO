# Access the Neutron Monitor database with python

![NMDB Logo](https://www.nmdb.eu/img/nmdb-6.png "NMDB")

The nmdb project provides python functions to access the
[Neutron Monitor database][nmdb].

---

`nmdb_realtime` is an example to access realtime data,
as presented in a [tutorial][realtime] at the [NMDB hybrid conference in 2022][conf2022].

`nmdb_nest_single` and `nmdb_nest_multi` are examples to get data from the
[NEST][nest] interface into a pandas dataframe.
