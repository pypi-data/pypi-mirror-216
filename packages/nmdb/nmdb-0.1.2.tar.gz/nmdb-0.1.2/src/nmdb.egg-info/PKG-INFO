# Access the Neutron Monitor database with python

![NMDB Logo](https://www.nmdb.eu/img/nmdb-6.png "NMDB")

This package provides python functions to access data from the
[Neutron Monitor database][nmdb].

# Installation

You can install directly from PyPI using
```
pip install nmdb
```

# Usage

- `nmdb_realtime` is an example to access realtime data,
as presented in a [tutorial][realtime] at the [NMDB hybrid conference in 2022][conf2022].

- `nmdb_nest_single` and `nmdb_nest_multi` are examples to get data from the
[NEST][nest] interface into a pandas dataframe.
These examples use the nest module from the nmdb package to generate html strings to query NEST.

- `nmdb_conf2022` is the script that creates the coverpage plot for the 2022 NMDB conference.
The plot shows GLE70 data as downloaded from NMDB 
(with the data header manually edited so that the data can be read easily with pandas). 
The plots are created using seaborn.
