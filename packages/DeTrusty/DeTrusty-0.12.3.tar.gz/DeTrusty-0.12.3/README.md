DeTrusty is a federated query engine.
At this stage, only SPARQL endpoints are supported.
DeTrusty differs from other query engines through its focus on the explainability and trustworthiness of the query result.

**Notice: DeTrusty is under active development! 
The current version is a federated query engine following the SPARQL 1.1 protocol, i.e., you can use the SERVICE clause to specify the endpoint.
However, the parts about the explainability and trustworthiness have not been implemented yet.**

DeTrusty only supports `SELECT` queries.
The following SPARQL 1.1 operations are not supported (yet):
- Conditional functions, e.g., `IF`, `BOUND`, `COALESCE`
- `HAVING` clause
- Complex expressions
- Built-in functions, e.g., `isIRI`, `STRLEN`, `abs`, `floor`, `now`, `month`, `MD5`
- Specifying RDF datasets using `FROM`, `FROM NAMED`, or `GRAPH`

This list might not be exhaustive. Please, let us know if we missed something.

## Running DeTrusty
DeTrusty can be used in two different ways: (i) as a Service by running it with Docker, and (ii) as a Python library within your own project.
Both methods will be explained in the following section.

### DeTrusty as a Service
In order to use DeTrusty as a service, you need to execute the following steps:

1. Pull the Docker image `docker pull sdmtib/detrusty:latest`
2. Start the container `docker run --name DeTrusty -p 5000:5000 -v $(pwd)/Config:/DeTrusty/Config -d sdmtib/detrusty:latest`
3. Create the file `./Config/endpoints.txt`
4. Add the URLs to the SPARQL endpoints you want to include in the federation to that file; one URL per line and accessible from within the container.
5. Now it is time to collect the metadata necessary for DeTrusty to operate as expected. `docker exec -it DeTrusty bash -c 'create_rdfmts.py -s /DeTrusty/Config/endpoints.txt'`
6. Once the metadata is collected, restart the workers in order to reload the configuration. `docker exec -it DeTrusty restart_workers.sh`
7. After restarting the workers, you can use DeTrusty to query your federation. When running DeTrusty as a service, you can access it through (i) an API, (ii) a command line interface, and (iii) a graphical user interface.

#### DeTrusty as a Service: API
You can use DeTrusty by making POST requests to its API.
If you started the container as described above, the base URL of the API is `localhost:5000`.
In the following, the different API calls are described.

##### /version
Returns the version number of DeTrusty.

Example call:

```bash
curl -X POST localhost:5000/version
```

Example output:

``DeTrusty v0.7.0``

##### /sparql
This API call is used to send a query to the federation and retrieve the result.
The result will be returned as a JSON (see example below).

Example call:

```bash
curl -X POST -d "query=SELECT ?s WHERE { ?s a <http://dbpedia.org/ontology/Scientist> } LIMIT 10" localhost:5000/sparql
```

Example output for the above query (shortened to two results):

```yaml
{
  "cardinality": 10,
  "execution_time": 0.1437232494354248,
  "output_version": "2.0",
  "head": { "vars": ["s"] },
  "results": {
    "bindings": [
      {
        "__meta__": { "is_verified": True },
        "s": {
          "type": "uri",
          "value": "http://dbpedia.org/resource/A.E._Dick_Howard"
        }
      },
      {
        "__meta__": { "is_verified": True },
        "s": {
          "type": "uri",
          "value": "http://dbpedia.org/resource/A.F.P._Hulsew√©"
        }
      },
    ]
  }
}
```

- 'cardinality' is the number (integer) of results retrieved
- 'execution_time' (float) gives the time in seconds the query engine has spent collecting the results
- 'output_version' (string) indicates the version number of the output format, i.e., to differentiate the current output from possibly changed output in the future
- 'variables' (list) returns a list of the variables found in the query
- 'result' is a list of dictionaries containing the results of the query, using the variables as keys;
  metadata about the result verification is included in the key '\_\_meta\_\_'.
  The current version returns all results as verified as can be seen in the key 'is_verified' of the metadata.

When sending a SPARQL 1.1 query with the SERVICE clause, you need to set the `sparql1_1` flag to `True`:
```bash
curl -X POST -d "query=SELECT ?s WHERE { SERVICE <https://dbpedia.org/sparql> { ?s a <http://dbpedia.org/ontology/Scientist> }} LIMIT 10" -d "sparql1_1=True" localhost:5000/sparql
```

#### DeTrusty as a Service: CLI
You can also run DeTrusty from the command line.
The following example call assumes a query stored in a file `./query.sparql`.

```bash
docker exec -it DeTrusty bash -c 'python runDeTrusty.py -q ./query.sparql'
```

If you want to execute a SPARQL 1.1 query with the SERVICE clause, add `-o True`.

#### DeTrusty as a Service: GUI
Starting with version 0.4.0, DeTrusty also comes with a Web interface.
Hence, you can run queries using your favorite browser.
The Web interface uses the JavaScript library [YASGUI](https://triply.cc/docs/yasgui).
If you started the container as described above, the interface is accessible at `localhost:5000/sparql`.

Starting with version 0.11.0, the GUI of DeTrusty also produces the query execution plan of a SPARQL query.
If you started the container as described above, the query plan interface is accessible at `localhost:5000/query_plan`.

### DeTrusty as a Library
Starting with version 0.5.0, DeTrusty can also be used as a library. You first need to install it via `python3 -m pip install DeTrusty`.
The following example script shows how you can use DeTrusty within your project.

```python
from DeTrusty.Molecule.MTCreation import create_rdfmts
from DeTrusty import run_query

endpoints = ['http://url_to_endpoint_1', 'https://url_to_endpoint_2:port/sparql']
create_rdfmts(endpoints, './Config/rdfmts.json')

query = "SELECT ?s WHERE { ?s a <http://dbpedia.org/ontology/Scientist> } LIMIT 10"
query_result = run_query(query)

print(query_result)
```

Of course, you can also further process the results according to your needs.

If you want to execute a SPARQL 1.1 query with the SERVICE clause, add the parameter `sparql_one_dot_one=True` to your call of `run_query`.
It is also not necessary to collect the metadata in that case.

```python
from DeTrusty import run_query

query = "SELECT ?s WHERE { SERVICE <https://dbpedia.org/sparql> { ?s a <http://dbpedia.org/ontology/Scientist> }} LIMIT 10"
query_result = run_query(query, sparql_one_dot_one=True)

print(query_result)
```

#### Running Multiple Queries
The aforementioned method is not very performant in a use case where multiple queries will be executed over the same federation of endpoints.
This is due to the fact, that the `run_query` method will read the metadata from file by default.
You can keep the metadata in its internal representation and pass it to the `run_query` method in oder to save the time of reading it from file everytime.

```python
from DeTrusty.Molecule.MTCreation import create_rdfmts
from DeTrusty import run_query

endpoints = ['http://url_to_endpoint_1', 'https://url_to_endpoint_2:port/sparql']
config = create_rdfmts(endpoints, None)  # returns the configuration instead of writing it to a file 

query = "SELECT ?s WHERE { ?s a <http://dbpedia.org/ontology/Scientist> } LIMIT 10"
query_result = run_query(query, config=config)  # pass config file to avoid reading from file again
print(query_result)

query2 = "SELECT ?s WHERE { ?s a <http://dbpedia.org/ontology/City> } LIMIT 10"
query2_result = run_query(query2, config=config)  # pass config file to avoid reading from file again
print(query2_result)
```

If you want to keep the configuration for later so that you do not need to compute it again, you can save it to a file:
```python
config.saveToFile('./Config/rdfmts.json')
```

## Private Endpoints
Starting with version 0.6.0, DeTrusty can handle private endpoints that require authentication via tokens.
DeTrusty assumes that there is a server providing these tokens and that the response includes the token in the `access_token` field together with the lifespan of the token in seconds (`expires_in`).

The aforementioned configuration of DeTrusty changes slightly when using private endpoints since additional information is needed.

### DeTrusty as a Service
If you run DeTrusty as a service, in step 3, you will use the file `./Config/endpoints.json` instead of a plain text version.
The file should look like this:
```json
{
  "https://url_to_endpoint_1": {
    "keycloak": "https://url_to_token_server",
    "username": "YOUR_USERNAME",
    "password": "YOUR_PASSWORD"
  }
}
```
Each endpoint is a single JSON object identified by its URL (as key).
The key `keycloak` is the URL to the token server; `username` and `password` represent the credentials for the token server.
In step 5, you need to adjust the file name to the JSON file and add the `-j` switch to tell the script that you are using JSON input.
```bash
docker exec -it DeTrusty bash -c 'create_rdfmts.py -s /DeTrusty/Config/endpoints.json -j'
```

**Note:**
If your SPARQL endpoint uses basic authentication with Base64 encoding instead of a token server, simply omit the entry for `keycloak`.

### DeTrusty as a Library
If you use DeTrusty as a library, you will need to pass a dictionary to the `create_rdfmts()` method instead of list.
The following example shows how:

```python
from DeTrusty.Molecule.MTCreation import create_rdfmts
from DeTrusty.Molecule.MTManager import ConfigFile

endpoints = {
  'https://url_to_endpoint_1': {
    'keycloak': 'https://url_to_token_server',
    'username': 'YOUR_USERNAME',
    'password': 'YOUR_PASSWORD'
  }
}
rdfmt_file = './Config/rdfmts.json'
create_rdfmts(endpoints, rdfmt_file)
config = ConfigFile(rdfmt_file)
```
The keys of the `endpoint_dict` are the URLs of the SPARQL endpoints; just as in the `endpoints.json` file described above.
Each endpoint is represented as a dictionary itself; holding all parameters in the form of (key, value) pairs.

## Metadata from RML Mappings
Starting with version 0.6.0, DeTrusty can collect the metadata necessary for source selection and decomposition from RML mappings.
Collecting the metadata from RML mappings instead from the SPARQL endpoint considerably increases the performance of the metadata collection process.
Of course, this is only feasible for endpoints that were created using RML mappings.

The aforementioned configuration of DeTrusty changes slightly when collecting the metadata from RML mappings.

### DeTrusty as a Service
If you run DeTrusty as a service, in step 3, you will use the file `./Config/endpoints.json` instead of a plain text version.
The file should look like this:
```json
{
  "https://url_to_endpoint_1": {
    "mappings": [
      "path/to/mapping/file1",
      "path/to/mapping/file2"
    ]
  }
}
```
Each endpoint is a single JSON object identified by its URL (as key).
The key `mappings` is a list of all mapping files associated with the endpoint.
In step 5, you need to adjust the file name to the JSON file and add the `-j` switch to tell the script that you are using JSON input.
```bash
docker exec -it DeTrusty bash -c 'create_rdfmts.py -s /DeTrusty/Config/endpoints.json -j'
```

### DeTrusty as a Library
If you use DeTrusty as a library, you will need to pass a dictionary to the `create_rdfmts()` method instead of list.
The following example shows how:

```python
from DeTrusty.Molecule.MTCreation import create_rdfmts
from DeTrusty.Molecule.MTManager import ConfigFile

endpoints = {
  'https://url_to_endpoint_1': {
    'mappings': [
      'path/to/mapping/file1',
      'path/to/mapping/file2'
    ]
  }
}
rdfmt_file = './Config/rdfmts.json'
create_rdfmts(endpoints, rdfmt_file)
config = ConfigFile(rdfmt_file)
```
The keys of the `endpoint_dict` are the URLs of the SPARQL endpoints; just as in the `endpoints.json` file described above.
Each endpoint is represented as a dictionary itself; holding a list with all mapping files associated with the endpoint under the key `mappings`.

## Restricting Classes of an Endpoint
Starting with version 0.7.0, DeTrusty can restrict the collection of metadata to specific classes of an endpoint.
The mentioned classes need to be specified using their full URI.

The aforementioned configuration of DeTrusty changes slightly when collecting the metadata from RML mappings.

### DeTrusty as a Service
If you run DeTrusty as a service, in step 3, you will use the file `./Config/endpoints.json` instead of a plain text version.
The file should look like this:
```json
{
  "https://url_to_endpoint_1": {
    "types": [
      "http://example.com/ontology/ClassA",
      "http://example.com/ontology/ClassB"
    ]
  }
}
```
Each endpoint is a single JSON object identified by its URL (as key).
The key `types` is a list of RDF classes for which the metadata will be collected.
All other RDF classes in the endpoint will be ignored.
In step 5, you need to adjust the file name to the JSON file and add the `-j` switch to tell the script that you are using JSON input.
```bash
docker exec -it DeTrusty bash -c 'create_rdfmts.py -s /DeTrusty/Config/endpoints.json -j'
```

### DeTrusty as a Library
If you use DeTrusty as a library, you will need to pass a dictionary to the `create_rdfmts()` method instead of list.
The following example shows how:

```python
from DeTrusty.Molecule.MTCreation import create_rdfmts
from DeTrusty.Molecule.MTManager import ConfigFile

endpoints = {
  'https://url_to_endpoint_1': {
    'types': [
      'http://example.com/ontology/ClassA',
      'http://example.com/ontology/ClassB'
    ]
  }
}
rdfmt_file = './Config/rdfmts.json'
create_rdfmts(endpoints, rdfmt_file)
config = ConfigFile(rdfmt_file)
```
The keys of the `endpoint_dict` are the URLs of the SPARQL endpoints; just as in the `endpoints.json` file described above.
Each endpoint is represented as a dictionary itself; holding a list with the RDF classes that should be considered during the metadata extraction under the key `types`.
