while keeping your data pipelines clean and manageable.

# Installation
```shell
pip install openfs
```

## Quick Start
### Creating a Store
``` python
import openfs as fs
from openfs.stores import FeatureStore
from openfs.boosters import Booster
import os

# <- import files to upload here

# Connect to store bucket
fs.client.connect(
    region_name=os.environ['FSTORE_REGION'],
    endpoint_url=os.environ['FSTORE_ENDPOINT_URL'],
    access_key_id=os.environ['FSTORE_ACCESS_KEY'],
    secret_access_key=os.environ['FSTORE_SECRET_KEY']
)

# Create store
store = FeatureStore("store_name", "description of store", "some_primary_key")

# Upload store
response = store.upload(files, filenames)
```

### Creating a Booster Dataset
``` python
# Create booster
booster = Booster(store_id=response['store_id'])

# Add features
booster.add_single("feature_1", alias="alias_for_feature")
booster.add_group(["feature_2", "feature_3"], alias="grouped_feature", how='sum')

# pull features from store (for testing)
df = booster.create_df()

# upload booster
booster.upload(name="booster_name", description="booster description")
```

### Viewing Stores

```python
fb.client.list_stores()
```
