# Gorilla CLI

Gorilla CLI revolutionizes your command-line interactions with a user-centric tool that understands natural language commands. Simply state your objective, and Gorilla CLI will generate potential commands for execution. No more need to recall intricate command-line arguments!

Developed by UC Berkeley as a research prototype, Gorilla-CLI prioritizes user control and confidentiality:
 - Commands are executed solely with your explicit approval.
 - While we utilize queries and error logs (stderr) for model enhancement, we NEVER collect output data (stdout).

## Getting Started

You can readily install Gorilla CLI via pip. 

```bash
pip install gorilla-cli
```

## Usage

Activate Gorilla CLI with a straightforward `go` followed by your command in plain English.

For instance, to list all files in the current directory, type:

```bash
$ gorilla I want to list all files in the current directory
```

Gorilla CLI will then generate potential commands. Simply use the arrow keys to navigate through the options, then press enter to execute the chosen command. 

```
ü¶ç  Welcome to Gorilla. Use arrows to select
 ¬ª ls
   ls -l
   ls -al
```

## How It Works

Gorilla-CLI fuses the capabilities of various Language Learning Models (LLMs) like [Gorilla LLM](https://github.com/ShishirPatil/gorilla/), OpenAI's GPT-4, Claude v1, and others to present a user-friendly command-line interface. For each user query, we gather responses from all contributing LLMs, filter, sort, and present you with the most relevant options.
