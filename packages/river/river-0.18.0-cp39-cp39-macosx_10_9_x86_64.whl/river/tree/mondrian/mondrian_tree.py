class MondrianTree(abc.ABC):
    """Base class for Mondrian Trees.

    This is an **abstract class**, so it cannot be used directly. It defines base operations
    and properties that all the Mondrian Trees must inherit or implement according to
    their own design.

    Parameters
    ----------
    step
        Step parameter of the tree.
    loss
        Loss to minimize for each node of the tree
        Pick between: "log", ...
    use_aggregation
        Whether or not the tree should it use aggregation.
    split_pure
        Whether or not the tree should split pure leaves when training.
    iteration
        Number of iterations to run when training.
    seed
        Random seed for reproducibility.
