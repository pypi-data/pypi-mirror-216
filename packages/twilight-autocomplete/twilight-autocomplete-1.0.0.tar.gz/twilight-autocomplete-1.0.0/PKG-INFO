# **Twilight-Autocomplete**

## _Twilight-Autocomplete is a powerful Python library that provides intelligent autocomplete functionality for text-based applications. Whether you're working on a chatbot, text editor, or any other application that requires intelligent text completion, ## Twilight-Autocomplete has got you covered. Developed by Avneh S. Bhatia, this library leverages the power of NLP and machine learning techniques to predict the next word in a sentence based on a given context._

## **Features**
## * _Efficient training of language models using the nltk library_
## * _Support for n-gram language models for accurate predictions_
## * _Simple and intuitive interface for easy integration into existing projects_
## * _Customizable n-gram size to adapt to different language patterns_
## * _Supports context-aware predictions for enhanced accuracy_

## **Installation**

## You can install Twilight-Autocomplete using _pip_:

    $ pip install twilight-autocomplete

## Make sure you have the nltk library installed as well:

    $ pip install nltk

## **Usage**
## Using Twilight-Autocomplete is straightforward. Here's an example:

    from twilight_autocomplete import train_model, predict_next_word, auto_complete

    #Train the model with an n-gram size of 3
    n = 3
    model = train_model(n)

    #Example usage
    input_sentence = "I want to "
    next_word = auto_complete(input_sentence, model, n)
    print(next_word)

## The above code demonstrates how to train a language model using the train_model function, and then use it to predict the next word in a sentence using the auto_complete function. The n parameter specifies the n-gram size, which determines the context used for prediction.
