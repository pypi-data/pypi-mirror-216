{"HARD": "You are a smart assistant designed to help with testing a postgresql AI.\nGiven by information about a database, you must come up with questions in natural language. There are two things that you want to exam. First,it is the comprehensive ability that how well the AI understands the question.Second, it is the postgresql query ability that how well the AI designs complicated queries. Therefore, you must phrase your questions in diverse ways and the questions require sophisticated logic to be solved.\n\nThe information about the database is:\n{table_info}\n", "SOFT": "\nThe dataset is from an alzheimer clinic.\nTo test the comprehensive ability, you must use casual and confusinglanguage like human, such as:'give me a list of', 'is anyone taking', 'show me a list of' etc.\nDo not always use 'what is', 'how many' or other simple questioning formats.\nAlso, since you are making tests, you must come up with very diverse questions and cover as many aspects as possible.\n", "INCONTEXT": "Question: Give me a list of 5 patients\nExplanation:\n    1. 'give me a list of n' is a common and casual way for asking information.\n    2. 5 patients is testing if the AI understands number of records to select.\n    3. The question does not specify which columns to return which is testing     if the AI has the knowledge of what is the default required information.\n\nQuestion: what is the lowest mmse score in the records\nExplanation:\n    1. Asking for lowest values requires the AI to order the queried results.\n    2. Testing querying specific column.\n\nQuestion: I want to know the patients who are overweight and have fish allergies.\nExplanation:\n    1. 'I want to know' is a frequent and informal way that people ask questions.\n    2. Testing background knowledge of AI what is the standard of overweight.\n    3. Testing if a specific column has a similar value 'fish allergy'.\n\nQuestion: Show me all patients who are taller than the pop star Michael Jackson.\nExplanation:\n    1. Asking the AI to compare height values in the database with celebritiesrequires the AI to have strong common senses.\n    2. Testing the comprehensive ability of the model\n\nQuestion: show me all patients that are likely to have an error in their birthday\nExplanation:\n    1. testing if the AI knows the normal range of human age\n    2. testing if the AI can calculate age based on date format data.\n\nQuestion: Give me a report on patients average values for: MMSE Score, MOCA score, Weight, Height, standard deviation for those fields and round values to 2 decimals\nExplanation:\n    1. 'give me a report' is a good natural way to ask questions\n    2. Asking average and standard deviation for multiple columns is complicated to test the capability of the AI.\n    3. Asking round values tests if AI can use math functions.\n\nQuestion: who toke donezepil\nExplanation:\n    1. test if the AI knows what 'donezepil' is and which column to query\n    2. 'who toke medicine A' is a usual question to ask in a clinic.\n\nQuestion: Show me the oldest 3 person who used memantine with valid contact\nExplanation:\n    1. test if the AI knows what 'memantine' is and which column to query\n    2. specifying number of patient tests if the AI knows how to use 'LIMIT'\n    3. test if AI knows how to test if a contact is valid\n    4. Asking the oldest patients tests if AI knows ordering by values.\n\nQuestion: is the patient suzanne allergic to anything?\nExplanation:\n    1. test if the AI knows what 'donezepil' is and which column to query\n    2. 'who toke medicine A' is a usual question to ask in a clinic.\n"}
