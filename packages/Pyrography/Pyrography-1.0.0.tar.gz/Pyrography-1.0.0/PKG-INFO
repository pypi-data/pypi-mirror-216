## Pyrography

> Elegant, modern and asynchronous Telegram MTProto API framework in Python for users and bots

```python3
import asyncio
from pyrography import Client, filters, idle

# Creating a client instance to control your bot.
# NOTE: Get your `api_id` and `api_hash` credentials on: my.telegram.org
client = Client(
    name='your_session_name',
    api_id=...,
    api_hash=...
)


@client.on_message(filters.command('start'))
async def ask_user_name(client, message):
    # Ask the user age.
    asking = message.ask("What's your name?")

    # Getting ask message and answer message.
    # TIP: you can to use `async for` too!
    ask, answer = await anext(asking)

    # Getting message text.
    user_name = answer.text

    # Replying message.
    await answer.reply(f'Nice name, {user_name}!')


async def main():
    # Start MTProto connection.
    await client.start()

    # Listen all command handlers.
    await idle(client)

    # When idle() is terminated, stop the client.
    await client.stop()

if __name__ == '__main__':
    # Getting asyncio event loop.
    loop = asyncio.get_event_loop()

    # Run main() function until complete it.
    loop.run_until_complete(main())
```

**Pyrography** is a modern, elegant and asynchronous [MTProto API](https://docs.pyrogram.org/topics/mtproto-vs-botapi)
framework. It enables you to easily interact with the main Telegram API through a user account (custom client) or a bot
identity (bot API alternative) using Python.

#### Why should you use Pyrography?

##### 1. Stop safety
Pyrography is the only mtproto library currently that when pressing `CTRL + C` to interrupt the program, it will wait for pending commands to finish, preventing anything from being incomplete.

#### To most performance and others

##### [TgCrypto](https://pypi.org/project/TgCrypto/)
A Cryptography Library written in C as a Python extension. It is designed to be portable, fast, easy to install and use. TgCrypto is intended for Pyrogram and implements the cryptographic algorithms Telegram requires.

Automatically installed, ignore it.

##### [Uvloop](https://pypi.org/project/uvloop/)
A fast, drop-in replacement of the built-in asyncio event loop. uvloop is implemented in Cython and uses libuv under the hood.

Install it with `pip install uvloop`, import it and call `uvloop.install()` in your main script.

##### Latency
On hosting, choose an region close to Miami to your machine.

##### Wonderful logging
Use the `rich` library to have pretty logs.

Automatically installed and default setted on `log_level` client parameter, set with `logging.NOTSET` to disable it.

```python3
import logging
from rich.logging import RichHandler

logging.basicConfig(
    level=logging.INFO,
    format="%(message)s",
    handlers=[RichHandler()]
)

log = logging.getLogger(__name__)
log.info("Hello, World!")
```
