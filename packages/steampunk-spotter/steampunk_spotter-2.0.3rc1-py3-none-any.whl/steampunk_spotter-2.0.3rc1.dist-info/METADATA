## Introduction
[Steampunk Spotter] provides an Ansible Playbook Scanning Tool that analyzes
and offers recommendations for your Ansible Playbooks.

The Steampunk Spotter CLI enables use from the console with the ability
to scan Ansible content such as playbooks, roles, collections, or task files.

## Installation
`steampunk-spotter` requires Python 3 and is available as a
[steampunk-spotter] Python package.

```shell
$ pip install steampunk-spotter
```

We suggest installing the package into a clean Python virtual environment.

## Usage
After the CLI is installed, you can explore its commands and options by
running `spotter --help`.
The `--help/-h` optional argument is also available for every command.

### Limitations
The current release version of Steampunk Spotter contains the following
limitations that also apply to the CLI: 

- with the FREE subscription plan, you can perform up to 100 scans/month,
- with the INDIVIDUAL, TEAM, or ENTERPRISE subscription plan, you can perform
  an unlimited number of scans,
- for the ENTERPRISE subscription plan, contact us at steampunk@xlab.si to
  discuss your needs.

### Authentication
To use CLI, you have to supply your [Steampunk Spotter] user account
credentials.
If you don't have an account, use the `spotter register` command that will
direct you to the page where you can create one.

Steampunk Spotter supports two kinds of credentials: 
* Your username and password.
* Your API token. To create and manage tokens, visit the Steampunk Spotter 
  App's web application, open the top-right account menu, click _My Settings_
  and switch to the _API tokens_ tab.

After that, you can start scanning right away.

```console
$ spotter --api-token <api-token> scan playbook.yaml
```

or:

```console
$ export SPOTTER_API_TOKEN=<api-token>
$ spotter scan playbook.yaml
```

or:

```console
$ spotter --username <username> --password <password> scan playbook.yaml
```

or:

```console
$ export SPOTTER_USERNAME=<username>
$ export SPOTTER_PASSWORD=<password>
$ spotter scan playbook.yaml
```

Steampunk Spotter CLI also offers for convenience the `spotter login` command,
which saves the chosen credentials (in plaintext) in your user profile:

```console
$ spotter --api-token <api-token> login
```

or:

```console
$ export SPOTTER_API_TOKEN=<api-token>
$ spotter login
```

or:

```console
$ spotter --username <username> --password <password> login
```

or:

```console
$ export SPOTTER_USERNAME=<username>
$ export SPOTTER_PASSWORD=<password>
$ spotter login
```

After a successful CLI login, the credentials no longer need to be supplied
explicitly to the CLI commands.

You can use the `spotter logout` command to log out from the Spotter user
account directly from the CLI.
This will take care of removing the auth tokens for the Spotter API
endpoint you are currently using that reside in the local storage folder 
(`~/.config/steampunk-spotter` by default) with authentication tokens.

### Scanning
The CLI `spotter scan` command is used for scanning Ansible
content (playbooks, roles, collections, or task files) and returning the 
scan results.

#### Ansible content
The `scan` command accepts a positional argument that can be one or many paths
to files or directories.
The CLI will automatically detect the type of your Ansible content and scan it.

The following types of Ansible content files are currently supported:

- tasks
- playbooks
- roles (applies to `tasks` and `handlers` folders)
- collections (applies to `roles`, `playbooks` and
  `tests/integration/targets/` folders and any playbooks at the root of the 
  collection)

```shell
# scan task file, which contains the `tasks` section of the playbook
$ spotter scan path/to/taskfile1.yaml

# scan two playbooks
$ spotter scan path/to/playbook1.yaml path/to/playbook2.yaml

# scan multiple playbooks using glob
$ spotter scan path/to/playbook/folder/play_*.yaml

# scan two roles (scans tasks and handlers folders)
$ spotter scan path/to/role1 path/to/role2

# scan collection (scans Ansible content within roles and playbooks folders
  and playbooks at the root of collection directory)
$ spotter scan path/to/collection

# scan multiple files at once
$ spotter scan path/to/taskfile.yaml path/to/playbook.yaml 
          path/to/role path/to/collection

# scan any folder that contains Ansible content
$ spotter scan path/to/folder
```

Let us assume we have the following Ansible playbook `playbook.yaml` file:

```yaml
---
 1 - name: Sample playbook
 2   hosts: localhost
 3   tasks:
 4     - name: Create a new Sensu Go user
 5       sensu.sensu_go.user:
 6         password: "{{ lookup('env', 'SENSU_USER_PASSWORD') }}"
 7 
 8     - name: Get the payload from the API
 9       ansible.builtin.uri:
10         url: "/some-url"
11         method: GET
12         user: "username1"
```

In this case, the CLI tool will report something like that back:

```shell
$ spotter scan playbook.yaml
playbook.yml:5:7: HINT: [H1900] Required collection sensu.sensu_go is missing
  from requirements.yml or requirements.yml is missing.
playbook.yml:5:7: ERROR: [E005] name is a required parameter in module
  sensu.sensu_go.user. View docs at
  https://docs.steampunk.si/plugins/sensu/sensu_go/latest/module/user.html.
playbook.yml:9:7: WARNING: [W003] Use of parameter user is deprecated in
  module ansible.builtin.uri. Parameter url_username is a new alternative.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Spotter took 0.329 s to scan your input.
It resulted in 1 error(s), 1 warning(s) and 1 hint(s).
Overall status: ERROR
```

#### Selecting the target project
*This part is only relevant for users with a TEAM plan or higher.*

By default, the scan results are stored in the first project of the user's
first organization (in the app).

Users that have multiple organizations or projects in the app can use
`--project-id` optional argument to specify the UUID of an existing target
project, where the scan result will be stored.

```shell
$ spotter scan --project-id <project-id> .
```

You can learn your project id by logging into the app, selecting the
appropriate organization, and navigating to the project's dashboard.

#### Including values
By default, CLI parses Ansible YAML content without any parameter values.
With values, we can discover additional tips for improvements, so if you want
to parse and send the values, you can use the `--include-values` optional
argument.

```shell
$ spotter scan --include-values playbook.yaml
```

#### Including metadata
By default, CLI collects and uses metadata (file names, line, and column
numbers, YAML markers) from Ansible content just for displaying the scan
output, which means that no data about your Ansible content structure is sent
to the backend server.
For an enriched user experience in the app and to get additional tips for
improvements, you can use the `--include-metadata` optional argument to send
the metadata.

```shell
$ spotter scan --include-metadata playbook.yaml
```

#### Automated application of suggestions to your code
There is also a `--rewrite` optional argument that rewrites your files with
fixes after scanning.
This action will modify your files.

```shell
$ spotter scan --rewrite playbook.yaml
```

#### Suppressing check result levels
You can use `--display-level` optional argument for suppressing check result
levels.
For example, to show only errors (suppress warnings and hints):

```shell
$ spotter scan --display-level error playbook.yaml 
```

#### Applying scan profiles
When we run scans, we might have a particular goal in mind.
For example, in one project we might be interested in upgrading our Ansible
environment to a newer version of Ansible.
In another one, we want to improve the playbooks for the Ansible version that
we are currently in.
This means that some check results that Steampunk Spotter produces may be
relevant in one of the projects, but not in the other one.

Using the `--profile` optional argument, we can specify a scan profile that
contains a selected set of checks to be used for scanning. Spotter currently
supports the following profiles:

* `default` - this profile is suitable for day-to-day testing and improving
  Ansible playbooks.
* `full` - displays the full range of check results, which would be useful for
  the Ansible playbook updating to work at a newer version of Ansible.
* `security` - this profile includes checks for potential security issues.

For example, to run all checks (apply `full` profile):

```shell
$ spotter scan --profile full playbook.yaml 
```

#### Skipping and enforcing checks
Sometimes, we might want to skip some checks from running.
For example, we might want to skip all checks that are related to Ansible
module deprecations and redirections.
We can do that by using the `--skip-checks` optional argument, where we list
the checks we want to skip by their IDs (E1300,E1301 and H1302).

```shell
$ spotter scan --skip-checks E1300,E1301,H1302 playbook.yaml 
```

On the other hand, we might want to enforce some checks that have been
skipped on organization level.
For example, we might want to enforce all checks that are related to the use
of with_items.
We can do that by using the `--enforce-checks` optional argument, where we
list the checks we want to enforce by their IDs (W1100 and E1101).

```shell
$ spotter scan --enforce-checks W1100,E1101 playbook.yaml 
```

#### Exporting and importing scan payload
To see what data is collected from your Ansible content and sent to the
backend server, you can use the optional `--export-payload` argument.

```shell
$ spotter scan --export-payload payload.json playbook.yaml 
Scan data saved to payload.json.
Note: this operation is fully offline. No actual scan was executed.
```

After that, you can also import (with `--import-payload` optional argument)
the exported payload and scan it:

```shell
$ spotter scan --import-payload payload.json
```

#### Setting target Ansible version
We can also use `--ansible-version` to set the target Ansible version that
Spotter will scan against.

For instance, if we want to scan for potential issues related to running our
playbooks with Ansible 2.9, we can use the following command:

```shell
$ spotter scan --ansible-version 2.9 playbook.yaml
```

#### Scan configuration
Before scanning, it is possible to configure the scan via the
configuration file or optional CLI variables.

We support multiple scan configuration sources.
The order in which we read the configuration is the following 
(in each step we overwrite what the previous one has, configuration files
should be in JSON/YAML format):

- local discovery of the user's environment (e.g., `ansible --version`);
- project-level configuration file (called `.spotter.json`, `.spotter.yml` or
  `.spotter.yaml`);
- configuration file provided as `--config` CLI optional argument;
- optional CLI arguments (e.g., `--ansible-version`).

All supported configuration options are shown in the configuration file below.

```yaml
ansible_version: "2.9"
skip_checks: ["E1300", "E1301", "H1302"]
enforce_checks: ["E005", "W200", "H500"]
```

For instance, if we just want to set the target Ansible version, we can use
the following JSON configuration file:

```json
{
  "ansible_version": "2.14"
}
```

And after that we can run the scan command:

```shell
$ spotter --config config.yaml scan playbook.yaml
```

#### Formatting scan result
By default, the CLI will output the scan result in plain text format.
The `--format` optional argument allows you to specify the alternative output
format of the scan result such as JSON or YAML.

```shell
# scan Ansible playbooks
$ spotter scan --format json playbook.yaml
```

#### Omitting documentation URLs from the output
In the scan result, the CLI will display a URL to the relevant Ansible content
documentation whenever possible.
To omit these documentation URLs from all the output, use the  `--no-docs-url`
optional argument.

```console
$ spotter scan --no-docs-url playbook.yaml
```

#### Managing custom policies
It is possible to create and use policies for custom Spotter checks written in
Rego Language for Open Policy Agent (OPA).
The use of custom policies is only available in Spotter's ENTERPRISE plan.

Use the `set-policies` command to set custom OPA policies.
This will override all current policies.

```shell
# set one policy
$ spotter set-policies policy.rego
# set a whole dir with policies
$ spotter set-policies policies/
# set policy for a specific project
$ spotter set-policies --project-id <project-id> policy.rego
# set policy for the whole organization
$ spotter set-policies --organization-id <organization-id> policy.rego
```

After that run a scan to see the check results you included.

```shell
$ spotter scan playbook.yaml
```

Use the `clear-policies` command to clear custom policies.

```shell
# clear policies
$ spotter clear-policies
# clear policies for a specific project
$ spotter clear-policies --project-id <project-id>
# clear policies for the whole organization
$ spotter clear-policies --organization-id <organization-id>
```

### Setting storage folder
The CLI uses local storage for caching access tokens for the Steampunk
Spotter API.
The default location is `~/.config/steampunk-spotter`, but if you want to
change it you can use the `--storage-path` optional argument.

```console
$ spotter --storage-path /my/project/.storage scan playbook.yaml
```

### Disabling colorized output
The CLI will colorize the scan result by default.
To make the output non-colorized us the `--no-colors` option.

```console
$ spotter --no-colors scan playbook.yaml
```

### Setting API endpoint
The CLI connects to Steampunk Spotter API (backend server) to perform scanning.
The default API endpoint is already set, but if you need to change it, you can
do this in different ways.

The precedence of the API endpoint configuration is the following, where the
first one specified takes effect:

1. the `--endpoint` global optional argument.

    ```console
    $ spotter --endpoint "<spotter-api-url>" scan playbook.yml
    ```

2. the `SPOTTER_ENDPOINT` environment variable.

    ```console
    $ export SPOTTER_ENDPOINT=<spotter-api-url>
    ```

3. configuration file from the storage folder
   (`~/.config/steampunk-spotter/spotter.json`) with the root JSON entry
   `"endpoint": "<endpoint>"` (this allows persistent API endpoint
   configuration).
   You should create it manually with the following JSON content:

    ```json
    {
      "endpoint": "<endpoint>"
    }
    ```

4. the default Spotter SaaS API endpoint:
   `https://api.spotter.steampunk.si/api`.

### CI/CD integrations
The CLI can be used in CI/CD pipelines to set up quality scanning of your
Ansible content.

When using the CLI in CI/CD workflows, it is important that you provide
Steampunk Spotter credentials as secrets (i.e., pipeline-protected and masked
variables).

#### GitLab
The CLI can be integrated with GitLab CI/CD to display scan results as
GitLab’s unit test reports.
This means that you will be quickly able to see which checks have failed
within your CI/CD pipeline.

This is done by using the Spotter CLI tool directly in the CI/CD configuration
and configuring it to output your scan result in JUnit XML format, which
allows GitLab to display check results as green check marks for successful
checks and red crosses for unsuccessful checks.
To do so, you should use the `spotter scan` CLI command along with the
`--junit-xml <path-junit-xml>` optional argument that will create a JUnit XML
report at the specified location.

Below is a `.gilab-ci.yaml` example containing a CI job for the test stage,
where you call the aforementioned CLI command and then upload the created
JUnit report format XML file as an artifact to GitLab, which will then display
it within your pipeline details page or merge request widget.

```yaml
stages:
  - test

spotter-scan:
  stage: test
  image:
    name: registry.gitlab.com/xlab-steampunk/steampunk-spotter-client/spotter-cli:<version>
    entrypoint: [""]
  variables:
    SPOTTER_API_TOKEN: $SPOTTER_API_TOKEN
  script:
    - spotter scan --junit-xml report.xml .
  artifacts:
    when: always
    reports:
      junit: report.xml
```

#### GitHub
In your CI/CD pipeline, you can specify the name of the
[Steampunk Spotter GitHub Action] (`xlab-steampunk/spotter-action@master`)
with a tag number as a step within your YAML workflow file. 

For example, inside your `.github/workflows/ci.yml` file, you can do:

```yaml
name: test
on: push
jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: Run Ansible content scan
        uses: xlab-steampunk/spotter-action@<version>
        env:
          SPOTTER_API_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.SPOTTER_API_TOKEN }}
```

For comprehensive usage and more examples refer to
[Steampunk Spotter Action on GitHub Marketplace] and
[Steampunk Spotter GitHub Action] repository.

#### Others
For other CI/CDs, we currently only support using the [steampunk-spotter]
Python package and setting it up as a regular shell command.
You can also use the [spotter-cli Docker image] that is available in our GitLab
Registry (use `registry.gitlab.com/xlab-steampunk/steampunk-spotter-client/spotter-cli:latest`
image path and select the appropriate tag).
You can use the `spotter scan` CLI command along with the
`--junit-xml <path-junit-xml>` optional argument to export the scan result in
JUnit XML format, which is consumed by some CI tools such as Jenkins or Bamboo.

## Development
You will first need to clone this repository.

```shell
$ git clone https://gitlab.com/xlab-steampunk/steampunk-spotter-client/spotter-cli
$ cd spotter-cli
```

### Running from source
If you want to run directly from the source, run the following commands:

```shell
$ python3 -m venv .venv && . .venv/bin/activate
$ pip install -e .
```

### Building Docker image
Before building the Docker image, copy the wheel file distribution to the
root of this repository.
Make sure that you have only one `*.whl` file.
You can build the wheel yourself or download one from the latest CI/CD
pipeline.
After that, proceed with the following commands:

```shell
$ docker build -t spotter-cli .
```

After that, you will be able to run scanning in a Docker container.
You can mount your Ansible content to the default `/scan` working directory.
The credentials can be specified as environment variables for the Docker
container or later via `--api-token` or `--username` and `--password` CLI
optional arguments.

For instance:

```shell
docker run --rm -it -e SPOTTER_API_TOKEN=<api-token> -v "/path/to/your/playbooks/:/scan" spotter-cli scan .
```

or

```shell
docker run --rm -it -e SPOTTER_USERNAME=<username> -e SPOTTER_PASSWORD=<password> -v "/path/to/your/playbooks/:/scan" spotter-cli scan .
```
