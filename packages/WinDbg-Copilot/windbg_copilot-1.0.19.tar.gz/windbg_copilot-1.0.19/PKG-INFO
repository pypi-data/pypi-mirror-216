                AZURE_OPENAI_KEY = <Azure OpenAI Key>
                AZURE_OPENAI_DEPLOYMENT = <Azure OpenAI Deployment Name>
        4. The Windows Debugger (Windbg) installed on your machine, for example: C:\Program Files\Debugging Tools for Windows (x64)
           Add environment variable WINDBG_PATH = C:\Program Files\Debugging Tools for Windows (x64).
        6. Add environment variable _NT_SYMBOL_PATH = srv*c:\symbols*https://msdl.microsoft.com/download/symbols
        7. Python 3.9 or later installed on your machine.
