when
****

A wrapper library for date/time conversion.  Takes many of the standard ISO
date formats as strings and creates an internally consistent datetime object.

Installation
============

.. code-block:: bash

    $ pip install pywhen

Supports
========

pywhen has been tested with Python 3.8-3.11

Previously it was tested with Python 2.7, 3.6-3.7. Not much has changed since
then and it should still work, but it isn't part of the automatic tests
anymore.
