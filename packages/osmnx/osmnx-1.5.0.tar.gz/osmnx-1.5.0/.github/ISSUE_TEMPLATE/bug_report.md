**Read these instructions carefully. Use the template below and fill out every section. Your issue will be automatically closed if you don't provide all of the information requested in the template, because we need this information to assist you. Before you proceed, review the contributing guidelines in the CONTRIBUTING.md file.**

Please don't use the issue tracker to ask "how-to" or usage questions. If asked here, they will be closed automatically. Instead, ask "how-to" and usage questions on [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/search?q=osmnx). If you installed OSMnx via conda and are experiencing installation problems, please open an issue at its [feedstock](https://github.com/conda-forge/osmnx-feedstock/issues) instead.

Bug reports are for reporting a bug you have found in OSMnx's codebase. First search the open/closed issues and StackOverflow to see if the problem has already been noted. If it hasn't, fill in the bug reporting template below.

**Completely fill out the following template.**

  - [ ] I have read the OSMnx [contributing guidelines](../blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md)
  - [ ] I have read the OSMnx [documentation](https://osmnx.readthedocs.io/) and [usage examples](https://github.com/gboeing/osmnx-examples)
  - [ ] I have searched the open/closed issues and [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/search?q=osmnx) for problems similar to mine

**Problem description**
  - What did you do?
  - What did you expect to happen?
  - And what actually happened instead?

**Environment information**
  - What operating system are you using?
  - What Python version are you using?
  - What OSMnx version are you using?
  - How did you install OSMnx?
  - Provide a complete list of your environment's packages and their versions (for example, run `conda list` or `pip list` then paste the output between the two "details" tags below)

<details>
# paste the output of your Python packages/versions here between these two "details" tags

</details>

**Provide a complete minimal reproducible example**

Your example code snippet here must be *minimal* so it doesn't contain extraneous code or data unrelated to your specific problem and it must be *complete* so we can independently run it from top to bottom by copying/pasting it into a Python interpreter. That means all imports and all variables must be defined. If you're unsure how to create a good reproducible example, read [this guide](https://matthewrocklin.com/blog/work/2018/02/28/minimal-bug-reports). Do not post a screenshot of your code or error message: provide it as text.

```python
# your code goes here

```
