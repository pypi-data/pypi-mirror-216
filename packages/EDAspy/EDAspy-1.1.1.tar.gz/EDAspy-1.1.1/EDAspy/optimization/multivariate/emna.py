    """
    Estimation of Multivariate Normal Algorithm (EMNA) [1] is a multivariate continuous EDA in which no
    probabilistic graphical models are used during runtime. In each iteration the  new solutions are
    sampled from a multivariate normal distribution built from the elite selection of the previous
    generation.

    In this implementation, as in EGNA, the algorithm is initialized from a uniform sampling in the
    landscape bound you input in the constructor of the algorithm. If a different initialization_models is
    desired, then you can override the class and this specific method.

    This algorithm is widely used in the literature and compared for different optimization tasks with
    its competitors in the EDAs multivariate continuous research topic.

    Example:

        This example uses some very well-known benchmarks from CEC14 conference to be solved using
        an Estimation of Multivariate Normal Algorithm (EMNA).
