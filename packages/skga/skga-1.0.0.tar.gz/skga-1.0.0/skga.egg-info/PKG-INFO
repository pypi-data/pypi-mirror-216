# SKGA

Welcome to the SKGA repository! This repository contains the `skga` package, which is a Python library for performing machine learning hyperparameters optimization. 

## Installation

To install the `skga` package, follow these steps:

1. Make sure you have Python 3.9 installed on your system.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt.
3. Run the following command to install the package using pip:

   ```bash
   pip install skga
   ```

   This will automatically download and install the `skga` package along with its dependencies.

## Basic Usage

Once you have installed the `skga` package, you can start using it in your Python projects. Here's a basic example to get you started:

```python
from sklearn import svm, datasets
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from skga import HyperBRKGASearchCV

# Load the Iris dataset
irisX, irisY = datasets.load_iris(return_X_y=True)

# Split the dataset into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(irisX, irisY, test_size=0.5, random_state=0)

# Define the parameters for the SVM classifier
parameters = {'kernel': ('linear', 'rbf'), 'C': [1, 10]}

# Create an SVM classifier
svc = svm.SVC()

# Create a HyperBRKGASearchCV instance
clf = HyperBRKGASearchCV(svc, parameters=parameters, data=X_train, target=y_train)

print("# Optimizing hyperparameters for accuracy\n")

# Fit the classifier to the training data
clf.fit(X_train, y_train)

print("Best combination of parameters found in the training set:\n")
print(clf.cv_results_['best_param_decoded'])
print()
print("Scores of HyperBRKGA in the training set:\n")
print(clf.cv_results_)
```

This example demonstrates how to use the `HyperBRKGASearchCV` class from the `skga` package to perform hyperparameter optimization for an SVM classifier.
