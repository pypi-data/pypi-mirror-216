# Pallet Simulator

Pallet Simulator is a Python package that provides functionalities for visualizing pallets inside orders and simulating
their stability.

## Installation

You can install the Pallet Simulator package using pip:

``` 
pip install pallet-sim
```

## Usage

Please refer to the examples folder for detailed examples on how to use the Pallet Simulator. The examples demonstrate
how to visualize pallets within orders and simulate their stability.

## Data Structures

The Pallet Simulator uses a JSON-based data structure to represent orders. An order object contains the following
fields:

``` json
{
    "orderID": "order_id",
    "pallets": [
        {
            "palletNr": "palletNr",
            "palletType": "EURO_PALLET",
            "palletDimension": {
                "x": 800.0,
                "y": 1200.0
            },
            "boxes": [
                {
                    "product_code": "0",
                    "anchor": {
                        "x": 313.0,
                        "y": 606.0,
                        "z": 0.0
                    },
                    "dimension": {
                        "x": 159.0,
                        "y": 298.0,
                        "z": 211.0
                    },
                    "approach": "9"
                }
            ]
        }
    ],
    "articles": {
        "0": {
            "description": "description",
            "weight": 5054.0,
            "shippingGroup": "A"
        }
    }
}
```

In this structure, an order consists of multiple pallets, each identified by a palletNr. Each pallet has a type
(palletType), dimensions (palletDimension), and a list of boxes (boxes). Each box is defined by a product code
(product_code), anchor coordinates (anchor), dimensions (dimension), and an approach value (approach).

The articles field represents the articles or products included in the order. Each article is identified by a numeric
key (e.g., "0") and has a description, weight, and shipping group.

The Pallet Simulator utilizes this order structure to generate visual representations of pallets and perform stability
simulations.

Feel free to modify and adapt this structure based on your specific requirements and use cases.

For more details on how to use the Pallet Simulator, please refer to the documentation and examples provided with the
package.
