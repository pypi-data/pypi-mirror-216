# HuggingFace Pipeline

This configuration uses the HuggingFace Pipeline LLM.

**Disclaimer**: The `dolly-v2-3b` LLM model has only been tested on basic use cases, e.g., greetings and recognizing specific questions. On more complex queries, this model may not work correctly. Thorough testing and optimizations are needed before considering a production deployment.
