# Apt Preferences

## Description

Python package to modify apt preferences files in line with https://manpages.debian.org/buster/apt/apt_preferences.5.en.html.

I don't like using awk and sed for updating preferences cause it's got messier the bigger amount of preferences is connected to a package.
If regexes are used in packages names then it's even harder. This package along with `re` should make more complex preferences scenarios easy to automate. 

And I wanted to learn `LARK` so that is also a big pron of the project.

## Installation

Create virtual environment
```
make venv
```

Activate virtual environment
```
. .venv/bin/activate
```

Install package
```
make install
```

## Usage

```
from apt_preferences.data_structures import AptPreference
from apt_preferences.render_preferences_files import render_preferences_files

# lets assume this is a parsed preferences file
my_prefs_l = [AptPreference(package="*", pin="release n=jammy", pin_priority=700, file_path="/etc/apt/preferences", explanations={})]

# we would like to change pin priority for one of file preferences
my_pref = my_prefs_l[0]

# pin priority is modified
my_pref.pin_priority = 100

# preference with modified pin priority is saved to the file
render_preferences_files(my_prefs_l)
```

For more examples look into `/examples` directory.

Run example
```
python examples/read_preferences.py
```

### Features:
   - Parse apt preferences' files into Python objects list.
   - Generate new apt preferences' files based on Python objects list.

### Planned features:
   - Support multiple pins in single preference.
   - Comment out objects via AptPreference method.

### Limitations:

   - If a line starts with `#` it will be ignored by the parser.
   - The generator doesn't allow creating lines starting with `#`.
